Erma Wood,00:10:39:01,00:11:21:17,"No, we had government help to start with, and, we paid for the sales through rummage sales and on different, things to bring in money. And we finally. Well. And we, the business man of the town, donated money to help us get started. And, we soon was able to, get away from the government help, and, that's so we paid for our building, which was $16,000."
Erma Wood,00:11:21:17,00:11:26:00,We paid for that in just a little over a year.
Olive Randle,00:11:26:03,00:11:28:10,and you earned all your money.
Erma Wood,00:11:28:12,00:12:09:07,"and now we're independent and and, and, rummage that we sell house, pay the, expenses. And also we have every Tuesday night. Bingo. Oh. Which brings in money. Yeah. And for a long time, we, saved the aluminum beer cans and full bowls and got quite a bit of money. Yeah, we, sell, we go through our rummage and, pick up to, things that don't sell well and, make good rags to sell to the powdered milk."
Erma Wood,00:12:09:10,00:12:14:20,"Oh, yes. and that brings in quite a little bit for us."
Erma Wood,00:12:26:05,00:12:38:17,Thank you.
Erma Wood,00:12:38:20,00:13:19:01,"Came to Saint Mary's and went to work for the Milwaukee Lumber Company. And, scaling. And, he worked at my friend one. And then they changed and decided to go up all the time on that. So my husband found, homestead, cabin, forest, alluvium, and, So we moved up there, just took a girl some bedding and dishes and clothing."
Erma Wood,00:13:19:04,00:13:38:18,"And so they camped out all winter. And we didn't have only one near neighbor. And I thought I'd just moved to the end of the world when I got there, six miles from the railroad."
Erma Wood,00:13:38:20,00:14:11:14,"Well, but anyway, we spent a good winter, and, yeah, there was a post office about a mile and a half from us and a little grocery store called Sylvester's Post Office. Oh, and I was on there for work. You know, I found it. Creep. All of them. What they call the mama law out of the barn. A lot country and, we used to buy fresh meat and eggs from this little store."
Erma Wood,00:14:11:16,00:14:13:06,Okay.
Olive Randle,00:14:13:09,00:14:17:14,"Talk to me. Deal about the, the shoveling."
Erma Wood,00:14:17:16,00:14:46:25,"Oh. Well, I think it's, the part that my neighbor wanted me to tell was, how I came from Spokane on the train, change trains here in Saint Mary's and went up the branch line and got off at the mouth of Alder Creek and rode a long train about four miles up the canyon and a lunch."
Erma Wood,00:14:47:01,00:15:11:10,"Our logging camp then rode the log train. I never 2 or 3 miles. And then, that's where we went to find this cabin and moved into it. Yeah, but if you shut it off, I'll tell you. I'm. So when I start."
Olive Randle,00:15:11:12,00:15:14:23,when you said you belong to the Spokane.
Erma Wood,00:15:14:26,00:15:38:11,"well, I lived alone in Spokane a month, and. And my three year old lonesome. And I told my husband that I would gladly live in any kind of a little cabin if I could be close to where he could be home. And so he found a cabin for us to live in was a homestead cabin. And, he."
Erma Wood,00:15:38:13,00:16:13:05,"So I came to Saint Mary, found the train, and then I came on up to the branch line on the train, and a log train met me at the mouth of all the creek. And I rode the log train for about four miles and got off and ate lunch at a logging camp, and then got back on the log train and rode, oh, by three miles farther, and then finally got off and lost in about an inch of snow."
Erma Wood,00:16:13:05,00:16:49:21,"And five who were shoes. And finally came to the cabin. But the funny part of it was the way I was dressed. I had on, real nice dress, black satin skirt, majestically poised with a and, black plush coat with a big fur collar. And there I was, riding on the greasy engine and, I don't know why I didn't have presence of mind to have robbers."
Erma Wood,00:16:49:21,00:16:54:22,"So I'm leaving Spokane, and knowing I was gone to the woods."
Olive Randle,00:16:54:24,00:16:58:07,But you said the humble skirt was kind of hard.
Erma Wood,00:16:58:09,00:17:11:07,"Well, now I had to climb up in the engine, which was a, real tall staff and I had on a hobble skirt, had to pull myself up to said mat greasy."
Olive Randle,00:17:11:07,00:17:14:19,And you.
Erma Wood,00:17:14:21,00:17:45:27,"But we finally came to the log cabin and and lived there all winter, and I thought I had just come to the end of civilization. I was six miles from a railroad. Never had been that far away, out in the woods, and had one neighbor, an elderly lady that hadn't been to Saint Mary's only once in eight years, so she couldn't tell me very many interesting things."
Erma Wood,00:17:45:29,00:18:16:00,"but we were one mile and a half from a little grocery store and post office. I am where you used to buy fresh meat. Maybe there. So we managed to live all winter, and I did lots of fancy work and read lots of stories and. And I thought if I ever lived through this winter, I'll be glad to go back to town."
Olive Randle,00:18:16:02,00:18:19:28,"But I lived there nine years. Oh, afternoon."
Unknown,00:18:20:00,00:18:24:17,"I suppose, did you have a good show? Oh, yes, we have."
Olive Randle,00:18:24:21,00:18:27:15,"Wood stove, probably. Jerry. Brother."
Erma Wood,00:18:27:17,00:18:46:05,"Have a nice spring course. Timber. Well, we finally brought my hand out there and lived for nine years out there. And then the youngsters who were old enough to go to school and so I moved into town. And I've lived in Saint Ruth ever since."
