Unknown Interviewer,00:42:27:12,00:42:34:12,"You ever consider, like going back, taking courses so that you could become a nurse."

But I had thought about why not. The children have been afford it and so on that I would enjoy going back to school, maybe becoming a nurse, because at that time my thinking was more towards the LPN and then maybe later going into Spokane being in Oregon, but now we've got the Oregon courses, North Idaho College."
Unknown Interviewer,00:43:08:10,00:43:11:09,Are you still concerned?
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:43:11:12,00:43:38:26,"I think so anymore, Look, I'm before I got remarried and Martin and I just rather be a partner when we get kids down for problem. Life is too big. Motorcycle. Stop or not hungry, work. Come back, be open. Just take up cross country."

Myra Jeanne Stark,00:44:11:18,00:44:15:25,But when I. If I had to be what we go.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:44:16:01,00:44:20:05,I have.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:44:20:07,00:44:23:19,I wouldn't get as many as I would have.
Unknown Interviewer,00:44:23:22,00:44:25:13,Three and something like that. I mean.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:44:25:16,00:44:28:24,I know that there's so many things going on.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:44:28:24,00:44:54:24,"Where I sleep. I. We can take her with us now. I gave her the motorcycle. Before she gets a driver's license, she can borrow the property with the bank babysitter. So Chris and I, once we get her the license family for rent, each of the back out behind the baby. Before we had three kids, there was no way we could take our bikes out from work because we have no."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:44:54:27,00:45:11:23,"And so I can't ride on the road. When there's so many things that you have to do, you know, like I can't because of the traveling homeless man."
Unknown Interviewer,00:45:12:05,00:45:18:24,"of course, what you learned about childbirth, childminding, I assume you had your children had to go home?"
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:45:20:08,00:45:45:21,"I'm not sure if I want to go through all courses before I had six or not. No, I right, because I had it with. No, at cluttering the clubhouse. It had prenatal classes before you when they taught you something so bad. Natural childbirth. And so I had to learn from that, you know, and then quit being interested in passing."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:45:45:21,00:46:15:14,"I got quite a few books, not technical books, fictional books on childbirth and so on. So I had learn from. That and quit since the time. But I was real interested in terms, like I said, I'd want to be a pediatric nurse, so between writing, the nursing and the children and so on, I'd read paper by. Did you have all the children that have gone through?"
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:46:17:19,00:46:23:08,I'm scared of a.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:46:23:10,00:46:28:13,Year to put up with trouble coming back to come.
Unknown Interviewer,00:46:28:15,00:46:38:01,"Was it a good experience for you for children? I mean, it was. Did it feel good physically?"
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:46:38:04,00:47:01:00,"For the pain and for me, it wasn't that bad. I read Faraday's law or so from childbirth, so it just wasn't any problem. But I'm having problems having my children. I've spent a long time with her, but that wasn't the point, that it was anything that work got seven or anything untapped."
Unknown Interviewer,00:47:01:02,00:47:14:20,"Just a few women there. It was really a beautiful experience. I don't know what I'm saying. She would almost have another child because of that, but that they only wanted to."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:47:14:22,00:47:41:04,"Yeah, yeah, that's not really right. But I mean, I think a lot of problem is the fact that going into it scared to start with. And I really feel that the natural childbirth courses are well worth anybody's time to go through because, you can learn to diminish the childbirth pain if you know how to react to it programing."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:47:41:05,00:48:12:17,"When you're scary, you can feel it, can't hurt. So my is that way with the shot or anything else. You just. If you can learn to relax and convince yourself that this isn't going to hurt, it's not going to hurt us. Better. If you're scared it's going to kill me. You know, and I really think that, you can never stop the fact that you need to have problems with some type of a pain reliever sometime that's doing all that they know that's going on, and they're prepared for it to an extent."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:48:12:17,00:48:16:28,It's not as bad as when they go into just cold turkey.
Unknown Interviewer,00:48:17:00,00:48:21:22,"Okay. I'm I think, what types of occupations for the other two guys?"
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:48:21:24,00:48:26:06,Yeah. They have to start meals.

Christmas was back in the French time disaster up here. And, I didn't have any qualms burning down underground because I would probably."

Myra Jeanne Stark,00:49:05:02,00:49:18:15,"This is the only disaster that we've had. as far as I'm concerned, just the one thing. I mean, it's more dangerous, I think, driving on the highways. And then I was working underground in the mine."
Unknown Interviewer,00:49:18:18,00:49:22:27,Had they changed a lot of safety precautions since then.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:49:22:29,00:49:24:19,I have been I.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:49:24:21,00:49:47:14,"Have asked, for example, here, which is a completely different name and sunshine and worker, if I understood it, I mean, I wasn't sure at the time and I knew nothing of it. The virus here, safety precautions are different from sunshine and of course each your company or different doesn't make me nervous for her, for my older brother."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:49:47:16,00:50:17:09,"And, because I take as much precautions. They. We can still go to work. I mean, you know, I'm here. I sit in the ground. He wouldn't go back to work. Now, the plants for anything are really hurting. He was going down a couple weeks before he went back. And within a certain length of time, I think his first week, he said they were going to come back and think, play like that."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:50:17:12,00:50:27:27,"And of course, and questioning if I have to work. And there he says, I wouldn't feel that way, but I get claustrophobic and I know I went underground. I was quite."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:50:27:29,00:50:32:16,Okay. I've never heard that the idea.

Unknown Interviewer,00:50:44:16,00:50:47:28,What is it about being underground that you like so much?

Myra Jeanne Stark,00:50:53:11,00:50:55:01,We really like it.
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:50:55:04,00:51:12:16,"Good for me, because I was working here in the timber down in a cinder. I think it's crawling now. It's like, kind of like an elevator thing. But they take the lumber down to the miners. This is what we can get. Chance to become a miner. You know, even that he."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:51:12:16,00:51:17:21,"Enjoyed, like being under there and."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:51:17:23,00:51:34:17,"Safe job. And this is what's important. Very. I'd never have him happy with me. Sad. Maybe there is more danger down there, but as far as I'm concerned, what happens with the difference? You know."
Unknown Interviewer,00:51:34:19,00:51:39:00,Are you concerned about the types of pollution that they talk about?

But I was wrong so didn't really know what's going to I think a lot of it."
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:52:08:03,00:52:21:22,"They need the precautions. Yes. But I think they're going overboard and trying to get them put through, preparing them some someone to come through. I think a medical about it were I don't think it would be quite that drastic."

Unknown Interviewer,00:54:08:15,00:54:28:03,"I mean, I have to think for a minute. Think the other thing, that we usually ask about. A lot of the questions that we ask are about the depression and things like that, that when this effected your life, did the war affect your life in any way?"
Myra Jeanne Stark,00:54:28:17,00:54:47:05,"not that I can think of, because I was just a year old and Pearl Harbor was formed and bombed, and then my father, gets, my, my son from going to the service and my service."

Unknown Interviewer,00:57:22:14,00:57:27:20,You would have just gone in there and done something and gotten out rather than sticking around and not doing that.

Myra Jeanne Stark,01:04:51:11,01:05:15:01,"I wouldn't mind learning mechanic so that when I was in high school, my heart stopped to work in mechanics. Of course, at that time I was very upset about I wanted to be a nurse. I come out of high school in mechanics and mostly boys, but so I could do it. And I don't mind getting dirty and greasy and what have you."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:05:15:04,01:05:17:21,Do they any courses.
Unknown Interviewer,01:05:17:21,01:05:21:26,Or were you interested in taking them? When you're in high school and out there?
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:05:21:29,01:05:49:04,"I don't think there was a mechanics course in woodworking for the boys and that type of stuff in mechanics. And like I said, at that time, I was really upset because I had so mechanical ability. Side counselor told me I'd be a good mechanic. My grandma says, what has the percentages even in that? Because they're nurses that work with you, people that are in the iron lung."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:05:49:05,01:06:02:28,So on some of these machines have to know mechanics to make extent to the or to get the machine working right away in case of the chinstrap patient means father machine.
Unknown Interviewer,01:06:02:29,01:06:04:29,So I really thought of it.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:06:04:29,01:06:05:28,On that terms.
Unknown Interviewer,01:06:05:28,01:06:12:24,But is there anything really more than to be important?
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:06:12:26,01:06:21:00,Okay. If you were a woman? not really. I am.
Unknown Interviewer,01:06:21:03,01:06:21:15,Kind of.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:06:21:15,01:06:44:26,"Anti women's lib to an extent. I mean, I really feel that women's lib had purpose when it started out, but I think some of it's getting carried a little too far. For instance, when a woman is doing the same type of job, it's men. Definitely they should get the same pay, but I don't think they should squawk and try to get every job that every man has."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:06:44:26,01:07:05:28,"I mean, just like up here at Bunker Hill, there's a lot. Must the girls come up there and work? And now they're winding down in the main. Well, there's no facilities down the mine for the women to be working alongside of the men. And, one of the guys we at first used to help the girls come up to Bunker Hill."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:07:05:28,01:07:25:07,"I like to think plants help women. So on for now. They're kind of the girls who can do it on their own. And I don't think a woman should have a job. Pays the same as man if she can't do the whole job, she has color. Somebody else can help to do her share of the job she shares and panic."
Unknown Interviewer,01:07:25:10,01:07:28:21,Whatever. They holler now or they're really doing it on the ground.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:07:29:19,01:07:30:02,they.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:07:30:02,01:07:31:08,I really don't know.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:07:31:09,01:07:53:08,"How it is now because like I said, my husband is underground where they don't have to sit there for a while. Thing is to kind of halfway expect the guys, you know, see the real world to having the guy come help me or whatever, you know, guy kind of gotten away from now. And I don't know just how much the girls are doing now to carry over to their for jobs."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:07:53:09,01:07:54:09,You know.
Unknown Interviewer,01:07:54:11,01:08:02:20,"When you say, I feel I need some ground time, better restroom. Are there any facilities for them?"
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:08:02:22,01:08:22:12,"Oh, well, there's there's places where, there is a restroom type thing. You most of the time I just as long as it's urinating, it's just in the ditches. And then they just don't even bother. They just. There's ditches with water. And then you go to."
Unknown Interviewer,01:08:22:15,01:08:26:06,So that doesn't matter as long as there's men here. But there are women in there.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:08:26:06,01:08:29:09,It was complicated. All right.
Unknown Interviewer,01:08:29:11,01:08:34:07,What are the other things about women? For years and six.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:08:34:10,01:08:57:26,"Oh, I just think they're making too big of a deal of it. I mean, like I said, I do feel that when they start out that they have too much or too much ground because there were women that were doing the same type job, man, they were getting almost paid because they were a woman, instead of getting the same pay rate as a man that, they're carrying it to such an extreme male."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:08:57:26,01:09:18:24,"But no matter what you're doing or what kind of thing it is, whatever the men have it to now, she's a woman. Libber let her do it herself, you know? I mean, they all they're all taking the opinion that all of the women want women's lib. And personally, all I command open the door for me. Here you have the couch."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:09:18:24,01:09:24:20,"It's too heavy to move. Holler for the curb. No, I mean, I can't see but my back when I can get a."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:09:24:20,01:09:26:15,Man to help me.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:09:26:17,01:09:50:29,"Change a tire, I can change a car, Carter. But some man comes along and we'll playhouse help give him a change for her and the room. A lot of this because, I mean, you know, now that he's older, do it herself, you know, and or used to be, anytime a woman is stuck alongside the old man would always stop and help her."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:09:50:29,01:10:07:09,"In my old times, you know, I been out on the freeway in the rain, changing the tire. Nobody would stop to help her. There was a time when you didn't even have to worry about because the man come home and do it for you."
Unknown Interviewer,01:10:07:12,01:10:09:05,Yeah. What do you think about women.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:10:09:08,01:10:15:15,Work and for their children or for your. Well.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:10:15:17,01:10:17:18,I think there's.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:10:17:20,01:10:46:22,"Different ways of looking at your nanny is different temperament. Some mothers let me know like there's some mothers that are really, really content to stay home with their children all the time. Me, I need to get away from mine. Or I just know some part of the reason for my tough work, because it's like, give me a few hours away from the kids and so on, and yet there's I've got one girlfriend that she's got two children of her own."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:10:46:22,01:11:03:18,She benefits children all the time. Thank you. As good as can be. And I would be pulling my hair out if I had to put up with kids all the time. And I think sometimes I get better care and more attention from mother when mother's been away for a while.
Unknown Interviewer,01:11:03:20,01:11:06:20,Is that where have you been?
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:11:06:22,01:11:07:28,Yeah.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:11:08:01,01:11:37:09,"I don't go running around screaming quite as much, you know, and we're able to have more things and do more things work at your home because I do have extra money. But on the other hand, there's mothers that are just pregnant and they're just really meant to be at home with their children. That's all they want. And I think kind of up to individual family situation."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:11:37:11,01:11:37:27,I couldn't.
Unknown Interviewer,01:11:37:27,01:11:39:03,Stand to be home with.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:11:39:03,01:11:47:26,A whole bunch of kids all the time. I just I'm too nervous. In high school.
Unknown Interviewer,01:11:48:13,01:11:53:18,what do you do as far as family activities at all here?
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:11:53:20,01:12:09:25,"Oh, we do lots of things. We got all these cars together. We cut the motorcycle down or go fishing. We take the kids some of the times we go hunting and."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:12:09:28,01:12:21:18,Usually the kids are with us. Library filming or the theater. Of course. Marianne's babysit for me at the same moment in proper time. I think it's really.
Unknown Interviewer,01:12:21:20,01:12:28:02,No matter what we do this year for object.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:12:28:04,01:12:31:15,"Classes here, they're free for autograph readers."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:12:31:18,01:12:57:10,"And we don't ask for that often. And then when we're not going somewhere, she has the freedom of going. Why? She wants to like she wants to live extended like lots and lots of. She walks at the park or out chasing around countryside when they do on some certain summer time, we have Linda with us."
Unknown Interviewer,01:12:57:12,01:13:02:13,Another term? Yeah.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:13:02:16,01:13:05:18,So she calls me mom.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:13:05:20,01:13:09:09,"I know. Yeah, there's a big family there."
Unknown Interviewer,01:13:09:09,01:13:15:06,"For a while, and you know, I, she wasn't here, so. Yeah."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:13:15:09,01:13:25:15,"So we're down pretty well. Just, She wraps Martin around her finger, I almost."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:13:25:19,01:13:29:17,Yeah.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:13:29:19,01:13:41:13,"Guess what? She wraps Martin around her finger, doesn't she? When she wants to do something and I don't let her she go, sees Martin."
Unknown Interviewer,01:13:41:15,01:13:45:12,I'm. Damn. You're fine. You get your driver's license right.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:13:45:15,01:13:49:28,So they both agreed on that?
Unknown Interviewer,01:13:50:16,01:13:52:27,Earthquake. Vietnam track.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:13:53:00,01:14:00:20,"Yeah. You ready to go? I, for one, give my think for having you here. Oh."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:14:00:22,01:14:09:18,"Besides, what she makes me, she make me a nervous wreck when she was trying to learn to drive before she could drive, he said I was ready for her."
Unknown Interviewer,01:14:09:21,01:14:11:16,"No, I'm not the only reason."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:14:11:16,01:14:14:14,I just about. I just scared part.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:14:14:16,01:14:16:13,Of my wits. I said I'm a nervous.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:14:16:13,01:14:20:05,Wreck when my car.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:14:20:07,01:14:25:00,We come round the corner and I wasn't sure she was gonna miss the pickup that was coming around near the wire.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:14:25:00,01:14:27:15,Not really. She gets. Forget it.
Unknown Interviewer,01:14:27:18,01:14:31:26,I think I would have a hard time keeping someone very dry.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:14:31:29,01:15:06:26,"You know, I think it really is easier for, another person to teach sometimes than for you to teach your own children. These brings. I'm not sure what it is. And different person has more patience. I know I have more patience at times with other people's children than I do my own. I learn. But on the other hand, I think that if I remember being too close, I think at times people to really get the communication across on you expect more of your child than you could, maybe somebody else's."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:15:06:28,01:15:16:12,"I mean, you, some of the other kids, maybe you think, well, maybe they don't know me better, you know? But you're you're sure that they should know better."
Unknown Interviewer,01:15:16:14,01:15:19:18,When you think about their houses across.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:15:19:20,01:15:25:01,"The river in warmer weather, we're in here on."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:15:25:03,01:15:29:08,"Oh, well, it's all over. I mean, what's the difference whether it's in the house or not?"
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:15:29:08,01:15:32:27,No street.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:15:33:00,01:15:52:26,"I mean, at least some girls are being honest about what they are doing. And yet I as I understand most time the houses are kept pretty clean. They are checked in with doctors for the girls on the streets downtown. And where there's men, there's like going to be prostitutes of one sort or another."
Unknown Interviewer,01:15:53:16,01:16:09:16,"do you think it has an effect on the community and instead it could affect her bad affect? Her home. Why do you still have girlfriends? They come down here, they, you know, oh, this is my country."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:16:09:19,01:16:11:19,But right now we have seen.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:16:11:21,01:16:19:17,"That, you know, I have a contractor group. So, you know, I mean."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:16:19:19,01:16:36:08,"I don't see that we don't. I'm not in front of cars. Right when we come back and I see your car gone. Yeah, right. We go out while we stayed."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:16:36:11,01:16:44:14,"In close contact. Call us to talk to be home back then. Well, how would you do that? Because you don't."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:16:44:16,01:16:46:07,"You right now, you know."
Unknown Interviewer,01:16:46:09,01:16:51:29,They try to I guess it's like it's not going to fix them. Well.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:16:52:02,01:17:02:04,Great people come through and they turn it on. And what you can never figure out because they're know they don't want to go with your car.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:17:02:07,01:17:07:19,Three months ago got up. So the guys I'll going to.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:17:07:21,01:17:15:22,Want you know I.
Unknown Interviewer,01:17:15:24,01:17:20:07,It affects the whole morality of the farm or.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:17:20:10,01:17:26:21,"Just the women have decided that that's what they want to do. I don't know, but most of the people, pretty."
Unknown Interviewer,01:17:26:23,01:17:27:06,Much.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:17:27:07,01:17:40:22,"Guys, to go on the road for from here, from here, you know, because the water in the Gulf of Mexico come out. In fact,"
Unknown Interviewer,01:17:40:25,01:17:41:20,I think since.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:17:41:23,01:17:51:20,"I moved back to go come up there, you know, you know."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:17:51:22,01:18:15:05,"Yeah. But those are the girls on the street. Then I'll be there regardless. The one's in the house. You don't very. Most the girls that work in the houses have got families. You never. You know who they are. So, I mean, the the house and those aren't affecting. It's just the girls themselves are on the streets. They're going."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:18:15:05,01:18:18:23,You're talking about where she was asking about the house.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:18:18:26,01:18:28:10,"Oh my God, what about when I come to the house when I could."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:18:28:13,01:18:46:03,"Well, like I said, where there's where there's men, there's women, there's that. And so it's a certain amount of prostitution. No, not really. That's behind the covers or out on the street or whatever. And it's been going on for years, and I don't think they're ever going to get rid of prostitutes."
Unknown Interviewer,01:18:46:06,01:18:50:16,How do you do you think it's safe to walk? It's going to go on and on.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:18:50:18,01:18:53:00,I do it all the time.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:18:53:02,01:18:53:15,I walk.

Unknown Interviewer,01:18:56:00,01:19:00:13,"Do you think it's safer, more."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:00:15,01:19:07:06,I wouldn't have a that walk in Wall Street. Same one I do. But when I'm down here.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:07:08,01:19:07:21,I think.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:07:21,01:19:09:01,I think a lot of.
Unknown Interviewer,01:19:09:03,01:19:10:26,Prostitution.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:10:29,01:19:13:06,Would change that.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:13:08,01:19:21:15,"Think that there's a possibility. I mean, there's going to certain."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:21:18,01:19:43:05,"Branches, especially where there was the miners up here where there's not and don't necessarily have wives and so on that my husband was talking about there's several other guys I've got to pass and so on, and possibly it might affect them to where they would bother some girl on the street. I don't know what that would look like."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:43:05,01:19:44:14,Most people would go.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:19:44:19,01:19:49:16,"And hop like last night. You,"
Unknown Interviewer,01:19:49:19,01:19:53:05,"You come home. Like I said, I can't get to."

Myra Jeanne Stark,01:20:44:08,01:21:06:23,"I think it does to extent, because that way they know that I can go up there and get what they're looking for, where they don't have to. My you're not my three bothers some of the women down here. I mean, they just go up there without ever bothering you like around here. I think it really has to if they're going to have the proper thing."
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:21:06:23,01:21:13:16,You guys take the car for construction. That.
Myra Jeanne Stark,01:21:13:18,01:21:31:07,"Way, and you can run through there where I. I'm going up to the house where my girlfriend from the house is that Sergeant, I think say."
