Ella Lillian Olson,00;52;30;00,00;52;40;02,"Or suppose this whatever. we used to go down, once and make a play house. Oh."
Charlene Olson,00;52;40;05,00;52;41;02,That sounds fun.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;52;41;07,00;53;02;24,"I remember, so we used to drag boards down and put them in the trees, came off the trees. So we ate broken dishes, took whatever we got a hold to bring it down to where it wasn't too far from the house because the woods was below them. And then. And then we, We never had any bicycle or anything like that."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;53;03;00,00;53;07;12,Were. And there was no water that was up in that country that you.
Charlene Olson,00;53;07;14,00;53;08;18,Would hear if you're on water.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;53;08;19,00;53;17;26,Yeah. You called it for washing. Sometimes we go out. Was going to do the washing. There was and we had to go get a barefoot water heater before we could walk.
Charlene Olson,00;53;17;29,00;53;22;04,"Now did you think, three when you were a child?"
Ella Lillian Olson,00;53;22;06,00;53;26;15,I started school when I was five years old. I didn't understand English words.
Charlene Olson,00;53;26;18,00;53;31;19,"And how how what part of your experience was that? You, did the teacher."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;53;31;19,00;53;47;10,"And we had an old schoolhouse. The old schoolhouse was on that side of our place, and no French. You heard him. He was that my first teacher? I was five years old when I started, and we had three months in the spring and three months in the fall."
Charlene Olson,00;53;47;13,00;53;52;00,Now we probably had back to school. So you couldn't speak English. Goodness.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;53;52;03,00;54;10;08,"Beginning farmer. no. Well how did he treat you? Well, I don't know how he could teach us because as soon as we got outside that door, we all come through, and they tried to put a stop to that. We couldn't talk to. You ever hear in the schoolyard? Oh, let's see, that didn't work."
Charlene Olson,00;54;10;08,00;54;12;20,Yeah. Can you talk to that home after.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;54;12;23,00;54;29;02,"All that sort of talk and that's all talk between us? Yeah, that was a what we talk. And those American kids, they talk sweet. Just as good as we did back then. Since those that after they've given, they're just as good as we did."
Charlene Olson,00;54;29;04,00;54;31;08,You still take three oil.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;54;31;10,00;54;44;17,"Up in the my kids TikToks read first, they learned first. They'll never forget it. And now in the store, you can talk sweet to those people and they talk to him. He knows what they're talking about."
Charlene Olson,00;54;44;25,00;54;48;16,What do you remember? Did you learn English them when you were in school or.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;54;48;29,00;54;51;19,"yeah, I guess we must. I must learn that they must."
Charlene Olson,00;54;51;19,00;54;53;02,Have learned it because that's like your car.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;54;53;02,00;55;07;17,"And then there they were going to be in the schoolhouse, and my dad gave them an acre land up in the upper the north corner of the place. There was some folk who gave them that right here. Of course, he got another it because that's to make it legal."
Charlene Olson,00;55;07;17,00;55;08;19,"Oh, yeah."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;55;08;21,00;55;37;05,"But he gave it to them and they built a new schoolhouse there, Pleasant Hill. and then we went up there to school and, I think the first teacher that was there was his name was Blackie. And we had their first live up here on the roof. We stayed for Trout and Mr. Steele click with them then will find friends initially."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;55;37;07,00;55;40;16,Oh he was mean.
Charlene Olson,00;55;40;19,00;55;43;29,And you then went there. When did you come back to.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;55;44;03,00;55;56;23,"Go to school. Oh that's when I was in eighth grade. Is your first grade up there. Then we saw an ad in the star mirror that somebody want work through the morning. You go to school, folks, that we up there in."

Charlene Olson,00;56;06;03,00;56;08;13,"We went, all right. Yeah."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;56;08;21,00;56;31;11,"And they put the first graders down in the probably the third graders just up the numbers up and down. So the teacher would stand there and our friend put that in there. So, this girl that I sat with, she was two years older, and she had already learned the first one to learn what the future was talking about with you."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;56;31;13,00;56;52;19,"I think she said something in Korean. I didn't know what to say about understanding her. And so what she said then the research, she said, not in Swedish, of course. If I don't get up on a stump and keep on turning and turning on that front, he's going to be like, oh, that's what he told us. and I got on that stuck."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;56;52;26,00;57;02;21,"Oh, damn it, I believed it. Yeah, the whole recess, the 15 minute resale. I went around her, I don't know, let's go up."
Charlene Olson,00;57;02;24,00;57;03;27,At 3000.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;57;04;01,00;57;07;10,Where they know what they had come down from. Oh.
Charlene Olson,00;57;07;10,00;57;14;01,That's funny. that's a funny story. So did you ever find out that.

Charlene Olson,00;57;29;03,00;57;34;18,"well, there are a lot of kids, from Sweden. Some Norwegian parents here, although."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;57;34;18,00;57;35;08,They were all.
Charlene Olson,00;57;35;16,00;57;36;23,So you didn't feel.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;57;37;15,00;57;41;18,"out of place? Out of place? they were all Swedes, but in some."
Charlene Olson,00;57;41;21,00;57;45;27,"Families are in some areas, you know, where we were just all alone and everybody."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;57;45;27,00;57;48;07,But you can imagine those poor teachers.
Charlene Olson,00;57;48;07,00;57;48;20,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;57;48;24,00;58;13;27,"We had the have two young girls. It was the one her name was Rosa bore. Oh, she's just a young, you know, they just started teaching the new seven year old because they didn't have to go to university. Right. And she was oh, she was younger. And I think some of those two kids. And she would sit there and cry, because she didn't know what to do with the kids because they took over, you know."
Charlene Olson,00;58;14;02,00;58;14;29,"Oh, yeah."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;58;15;00,00;58;16;20,They couldn't handle and handle them.
Charlene Olson,00;58;16;20,00;58;17;15,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;58;17;17,00;58;32;14,"And that she was not there at all. She they had to get rid of her and they got her sister Rosa more upset, but she was a little bit better. But she wasn't very good either. You didn't see the teacher just had to get right down."
Charlene Olson,00;58;32;14,00;58;33;14,"Yeah, work right."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;58;33;17,00;58;39;26,To show on that. But it would either he gives them a lesson or because then they could give him away.
Charlene Olson,00;58;39;27,00;58;40;22,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,00;58;40;24,00;58;58;18,"And what he did it was feels good to them. He took two of the boys. I don't know what they have done. I don't remember. But he stood him up on the floor and they had to spread their legs where to? With him? And they kept on their feet till they curled together and come up there and kick them on the hill, crawling up their feet."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;58;58;21,00;58;59;17,It makes it.
Charlene Olson,00;58;59;17,00;59;01;03,Yeah. And how long do they have to stay?
Ella Lillian Olson,00;59;01;09,00;59;28;20,"They for half a day at a time. Life. And we just made them stand there. And and they. Oh. Is he good with penmanship? If he didn't write, I could never learn to make a capital J. I made this tail, and then I could go back and be better that and they were trying to make that J and you couldn't hear but can take the pen and stick it up on the lawn."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;59;28;22,00;59;38;16,"You know, or just up. Just tried night and day all night. You got home. Oh you mean you tried? I tried to make that joke."
Charlene Olson,00;59;38;19,00;59;40;01,But he sounded a little mean.

Charlene Olson,00;59;46;29,00;59;50;10,"I learned our lesson. Yeah, I guess so."
Ella Lillian Olson,00;59;50;13,01;00;12;21,"And, Mrs. Smith, listen to him. But they had to be you there. We had one that we like real. Well, her name was, she was from Avon. yeah. This one on the picture. She was. Oh, she was good. But the kids liked it. And she had control over the kids, and she was with me."
Charlene Olson,01;00;12;21,01;00;16;05,"That's it. I mean, you can have control over the kids. And still not."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;00;16;08,01;00;18;25,As she was good in the way to them.
Charlene Olson,01;00;18;27,01;00;20;06,"Everything, you know. Yeah."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;00;20;08,01;00;24;14,That's good. And they liked that. Or she could have them.
Charlene Olson,01;00;24;16,01;00;30;12,I see your TV. What programs do you like to work? Do you have any favorite? Oh.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;00;30;15,01;00;47;03,"I don't know. I watch, I used to watch Barker, but he fell for her and I watched Dial In for dollars from her, and, Oh, I, I don't watch very much."
Charlene Olson,01;00;47;05,01;00;49;18,You don't have any real.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;00;49;25,01;00;54;18,"No, I will if the world turns over the one better, Watch that."
Charlene Olson,01;00;54;18,01;00;56;18,Really interesting. Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;00;56;21,01;00;58;11,I never start any of those stories.
Charlene Olson,01;00;58;15,01;00;59;16,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;00;59;19,01;01;01;01,Just. I don't want him down.
Charlene Olson,01;01;01;01,01;01;02;20,"Oh, yeah. Right."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;01;02;23,01;01;15;00,"But it's the that, As the World Turns comes on at 1230 and is off at 130, and it just gave me a time I can lay on the bed report, but I sleep half of the time, so I don't sometimes what's been good."
Charlene Olson,01;01;15;02,01;01;16;23,"Yeah, yeah."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;01;16;25,01;01;26;00,"But anyway, I don't like anything that particular and I'm not so awful from coverage. Yeah, I just don't have good radio."
Charlene Olson,01;01;26;02,01;01;26;28,You read?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;01;27;01,01;01;28;23,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
Charlene Olson,01;01;28;26,01;01;32;26,"Yeah. But do you like to read? Oh, I don't know."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;01;32;26,01;01;47;01,"I've been reading, the church papers, but, Yeah. This this."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;01;47;03,01;01;56;22,"I'm. Yeah, this is a good one. I don't like that. Oh, yeah. It's different magazines. Different?"
Charlene Olson,01;01;56;25,01;01;58;11,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;01;58;13,01;02;00;17,That. I don't think that's an it's paper.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;02;01;08,01;02;08;26,It's some other. But it's good reading. so I don't know I don't read any of these kind of which don't seem.
Charlene Olson,01;02;09;12,01;02;19;20,"how do you think, like for your granddaughter or, or grandchildren will be different from what? The kind of life you read. How do you think kinds of things for there?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;02;19;20,01;02;40;06,"Well, the way it looks from my granddaughter, there was just they had a person in the early days because he's loud, he's working with little, you know, Montana and she lives up there and they use a coal mine alarm and she's way out of it. It's many miles out of Troy, Montana and in the woods. She lives down the track there."
Charlene Olson,01;02;40;08,01;02;42;09,They're gonna have a lot of the modern.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;02;42;09,01;02;50;10,"Conveniences or it's, the way she starts now for. I think she'll be horseback riding. Yeah."
Charlene Olson,01;02;50;12,01;02;56;05,"But, I mean, generally, do you think that the young people now will have, a hard life."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;02;56;05,01;03;23;12,"Or. Oh, I don't know. It's hard in a way, because they just can't get any work. And then it was work after the depression was over at work, and it seemed like it's been work ever since. It hasn't been too hard, but now they have put in some machinery that takes the place of man and people. So there's no work here."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;03;23;15,01;03;31;15,"And so it's it's harder in a way, on account of all the."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;03;31;18,01;03;35;18,But I think they get more education.
Charlene Olson,01;03;35;20,01;03;40;16,Oh my. That was in the paper then.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;03;40;18,01;03;42;24,Oh yeah. They were both in the paper.
Charlene Olson,01;03;42;27,01;03;52;06,Yeah. you know who made the decisions or how did you arrive at decision making in your marriage.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;03;52;08,01;04;02;04,Oh I don't know. It was also I maybe made the most because he was kind of quiet side. So I think probably it was.
Charlene Olson,01;04;02;06,01;04;02;24,Just down the.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;04;03;00,01;04;08;14,Road. Yeah.
Charlene Olson,01;04;08;17,01;04;17;26,"What do you think it was easier than or in some way for him to have come first. If you were the stronger one, do you think it would have been harder for him."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;04;17;28,01;04;41;08,"Oh I was so scared I was going to die first because he never had to take care of himself. He was he was just my purpose. And, he could. Oh, I was so scared that I was going. When I got that no trouble. I was just I was going to go get, it was cancer or something, and I died before him."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;04;42;02,01;04;47;18,"so when are you really. If afterwards, I thought, well, it was sure good he died first."
Charlene Olson,01;04;47;21,01;04;50;18,"You mean, helpless? In what way? You mean that he couldn't?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;04;50;18,01;04;57;23,"Well, yeah. Couldn't decide anything, I don't know, he was. Of course, he was getting old. He was 84."
Charlene Olson,01;04;57;25,01;05;05;21,"Yeah, he was older than I am. What do you think attracted you to him when you recording?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;05;05;23,01;05;10;05,"Well, it was up there at the point."
Charlene Olson,01;05;10;07,01;05;12;24,Where you met him at a logging camp.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;05;12;26,01;05;36;21,"Recruit. And I was cooking there. He come in. And if that girl that cooked with me there, she that was was her boyfriend. She that was her boyfriend. And he'd come in and then walk would come home to him and, wash dishes. Why, they take the dish towel, dried the dish. And I guess that kind of started."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;05;36;24,01;06;07;21,"But Warford had a girlfriend. You married so a week and couldn't go to dinner. Oh and so then I never thought about it much. So then one evening we would go a drive down to church. And that that was going to and courses. Oh my I was going to go and so they asked me if I wanted this my girl friends there, her boyfriend asked if I wanted him in the certain guy."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;06;08;11,01;06;29;08,"cook out the in the bunk house and I said no I didn't want it. I said, I just go with you and we do. And so then when we come go driving up the up from the mill up to the road, we never finished coming back from beer. Oh he stopped, he asked if he wanted to go alone."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;06;29;27,01;06;35;04,"What do you ask me first if we meet offered up in here, should we ask him if he was right? Yeah."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;06;36;18,01;06;44;20,"And so we went in there and he got in. I am, oh. He went to area a couple more times, and then he quit going there."
Charlene Olson,01;06;44;26,01;06;46;08,He started that. You better.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;06;46;08,01;06;58;28,"I guess so or something, I don't. And anyway, we come in in the evenings, they come in and they sit inside and talk to us. And that's how it started. I guess it just kept on going that way."
Charlene Olson,01;06;59;16,01;07;02;23,What do you think you liked about him? You must. You know that.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;07;02;27,01;07;12;26,"Well, he was sort of quiet, and he was nice to him. And I don't know, something doesn't come him. And then we went to the war."
Charlene Olson,01;07;12;27,01;07;20;04,"He was nice looking guy. Yeah. You know, to be nice, I think. Then. Did you correspond with my brother?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;07;20;06,01;07;24;06,"Oh, yeah. All the time. I mean, he was in my living room."
Charlene Olson,01;07;24;08,01;07;28;11,"That must have been hard, too. Not knowing you were going to come back or not. No, we."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;07;28;11,01;07;41;14,"Didn't know so many, didn't have hardly any training and just sent them over there. Gilda. And, But he was, he came back and. And then we started working again."
Charlene Olson,01;07;41;16,01;07;43;04,Oh right.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;07;43;07,01;07;47;08,And two years more. So that went in the boat.
Charlene Olson,01;07;47;12,01;07;48;18,And then after you got married.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;07;48;20,01;07;51;10,They always teased me with sweet beer and that's.
Charlene Olson,01;07;51;10,01;07;53;23,What I'm a lobster man
Ella Lillian Olson,01;07;53;26,01;08;02;25,That I got the man. Really? Yeah. so I don't want to hurry.
Charlene Olson,01;08;02;28,01;08;20;18,You think of anything else that we might think of or anything that you can think of that you might tell them. If a young woman was going to move to a little town like Troy. Buy who might give her about coming to a small town to live.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;08;20;19,01;08;41;00,"Well, I think if they have kids, they should go to a small town because they can get married here. They can walk up to the schoolhouse and then the service, they get out of school, or they can run home. And, so it's, it's better to be in a rural, fresh like this with being here and there's no danger."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;08;41;00,01;08;52;17,"Anybody picking them up? Yeah. You can feel safe that you no harm come and it wouldn't be a surprise. Yeah, but we were surprised, too. And the bank was robbed."
Charlene Olson,01;08;52;19,01;08;54;01,"Oh, you're bank robber?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;08;54;01,01;09;01;10,"Yeah, I was robbed. Oh, my. Oh, he locked up Rocky in the back and robbed the bank."
Charlene Olson,01;09;01;13,01;09;02;28,Did they catch them?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;09;03;00,01;09;06;18,Yeah. They got em.
Charlene Olson,01;09;06;20,01;09;18;13,So anything else you can think of about your life that the rural woman. Oh I don't know yet. what do you think about work in these present days. It sounds like you had your share.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;09;18;20,01;09;22;06,I have worked all my life. So.
Charlene Olson,01;09;22;09,01;09;26;15,What's your attitude or viewpoint about work?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;09;26;17,01;09;36;25,"Well, I don't know. It's your work, but you got something to do. You're more satisfied."
Charlene Olson,01;09;36;27,01;09;41;03,You think that people look differently work now than they did when you were growing up.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;09;41;06,01;10;02;17,Well now it seems like they just leave their kids babysitters and they just want to work. But it's everything is so high. And they premier have to they're going to make it. But they never stay home with their babies. They have their babies. And probably in a month they go to work and have a babysitter. Well they never they don't know what it is to raise their kids.
Charlene Olson,01;10;02;20,01;10;06;09,"Now when, when you had your baby you were home."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;10;06;09,01;10;07;16,When I was home.
Charlene Olson,01;10;08;13,01;10;09;16,But then you did work.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;10;09;22,01;10;14;18,And work then they were in school then and I was home. I just went for during the day.
Charlene Olson,01;10;14;20,01;10;15;23,You were always home before.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;10;15;23,01;10;20;11,I was home before that. And same time anyway.
Charlene Olson,01;10;20;14,01;10;20;25,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;10;20;25,01;10;28;23,"And then when I went to come here, my dad had been picking peas there when they were big. So they can take care of themselves."
Charlene Olson,01;10;28;25,01;10;33;29,Or what do you see happening to the children when the mothers go off to work like that?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;10;34;01,01;10;38;13,"Well, I think they get so surprised that they. If they just won't be able to live them."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;10;39;07,01;10;59;17,"Because when the mothers come home their mother just oil so terrible and I'm with the baby sitter. She gets some hit their way. And I think the kids just get ruined. You can see it on some of these ten years old kids, nine, ten year old kids. Just or a rotten baby if they don't get their way."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;10;59;17,01;11;03;20,What. They just sit there and pout.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;03;22,01;11;05;02,So I think that.
Charlene Olson,01;11;05;02,01;11;07;29,You think that parents act as if they were when you.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;07;29,01;11;17;28,"Were out here or were you either because then they could get them then. And the, the rest of us would get scared of government. And I, we tried to do."
Charlene Olson,01;11;18;00,01;11;18;13,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;18;13,01;11;28;06,But now it's against the law. Yeah. I don't think the parents are even allowed to get them. But they can now because they say they beat them up. Well I could easily.
Charlene Olson,01;11;28;06,01;11;35;15,Can thank them but just not beat them. Black and everything. But of course back then it was different. They could take them back behind the bar.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;35;16,01;11;37;13,"Oh, you were you."
Charlene Olson,01;11;37;14,01;11;41;28,"Do you think, you were pretty strict with your boys? They never would, boss."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;42;05,01;11;47;16,"Well, I tried to be, but you can't for a while. But then presume that you're old."
Charlene Olson,01;11;47;16,01;11;48;20,For that too.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;48;23,01;11;52;27,So then they going to stick with her. So it's an m to that too.
Charlene Olson,01;11;52;29,01;11;56;15,Yeah. You get them in the first few years and then.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;56;15,01;11;58;18,Well till they're through the grade school.
Charlene Olson,01;11;58;25,01;11;59;17,Yeah. When they get.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;11;59;17,01;12;06;24,Into high school it's a big change for her because then they just they just change.
Charlene Olson,01;12;06;24,01;12;12;00,"Now while they're reaching adolescence, you know. And then they think they know. What's that?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;12;12;01,01;12;17;06,"But during the eighth grade, since, you know, I didn't know that they could control."
Charlene Olson,01;12;17;08,01;12;23;07,"I think the parents get their chance. You know, the first they hear the first day grades, and then after that they hope they've."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;12;23;07,01;12;24;18,Done or.
Charlene Olson,01;12;24;20,01;12;25;25,The right thing.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;12;25;28,01;12;32;20,"But I think that the kids had, a really the first six years of their life is when they get their start."
Charlene Olson,01;12;32;22,01;12;33;10,Right.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;12;33;10,01;12;44;07,"And I think the mothers should be home with the kids, you know, be working. But, you know, but I don't think you can hardly find a place now where the mother stays home with her baby."
Charlene Olson,01;12;44;10,01;12;49;05,"Well, I suppose a lot of, like you say, a lot of people, they have to feel they have to if they want to keep them."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;12;49;07,01;13;05;11,"But yeah, it costs too much. They're renting or they're buying. I know they buy a house. They have to have the payments and all the other expenses. If they rent. The rent is so terrible. Yeah, that's different than $6 a month, I couldn't think. Right."
Charlene Olson,01;13;05;14,01;13;14;06,"Well, when you were a child and you were the oldest child, how did you find being the oldest child? Did you find that hard? Did you have to work a lot?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;13;14;08,01;13;29;28,"Oh, yeah. That's hard. It was hard. And I got blamed for things that they do wrong. And they got out of that. I was supposed to look after them and see that they did the right thing. Otherwise, I get it."
Charlene Olson,01;13;30;00,01;13;31;13,Did you have to work pretty hard?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;13;31;14,01;13;52;18,"Oh, yeah. It wasn't that my oldest brother, I was seven years old when my oldest brother there was born, and we were she had already had us three girls, and then he was the next year, the fourth one in the in this show, my dad showed me where I had to accept where he helped, which is very rare."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;13;52;20,01;14;07;01,"And then he told me when the bread got raised up, I should take pieces of it and put it in a pan, you know. But I knew that because I've seen my mother do. But I could never shape her. I just couldn't get them no shape."
Charlene Olson,01;14;07;04,01;14;08;15,And you were only seven years old.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;14;08;15,01;14;27;01,"Yeah, I was seven years old. And. And she was laying in bed. Hadn't hit him. And that. And then he said I should keep firing the stroke. Well I hit of course she'd holler at me how we do this and do that. And I tell you it's hard you know."
Charlene Olson,01;14;27;03,01;14;28;10,Yeah I think so.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;14;28;15,01;14;37;01,"And they ask about they expect an awful lot out of the group and the kids, they're really mean to."
Charlene Olson,01;14;37;07,01;14;38;20,Oh yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;14;38;22,01;14;41;11,"Because they can do things. And then we just say, no, she did it."
Charlene Olson,01;14;41;11,01;14;42;19,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;14;42;22,01;14;43;20,It's her fault.
Charlene Olson,01;14;43;22,01;14;46;02,So you had to do a lot of chores and and.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;14;46;03,01;14;56;07,"Oh, yeah. We ran about all the chores here. So when we come home from school, I went right to the bathroom, clean the bathroom and put in the manger. Some got the cows in."
Charlene Olson,01;14;56;11,01;14;57;14,Did your milk too?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;14;58;19,01;15;08;24,And did that part. My sister started peeling potatoes and cooked supper. It's she's baby and she and I went out and we had back to school.
Charlene Olson,01;15;08;27,01;15;17;23,Did your where your Were all the children pretty close together. Oh yeah. We grew up. Your mother wanted to have that bond to the family.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;15;17;23,01;15;26;27,"I don't think so because they didn't know what to do with it. Just got of. Yeah, yeah, but she lived to be almost nine, nine years old. To get her."
Charlene Olson,01;15;26;27,01;15;33;24,Ready. No it sure didn't did it. But yeah. Because even in your generation they didn't have as many children.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;15;33;29,01;15;37;01,"No, no they didn't know her."
Charlene Olson,01;15;37;04,01;15;41;12,Yeah I wonder why. How they presented themselves from having fun.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;15;41;12,01;15;54;24,"I don't know, they, I don't know. How it was, but we just didn't get through. Oh, I would have liked to kick them, too. I had a graphic of where I go. Yeah."
Charlene Olson,01;15;54;27,01;15;58;17,"Yeah. And nowadays most people don't have. No, they."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;15;58;17,01;15;59;13,Don't have so many.
Charlene Olson,01;15;59;14,01;15;59;25,Don't know.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;15;59;28,01;16;03;03,But I think they're getting ahead more though than they used to.
Charlene Olson,01;16;03;05,01;16;04;14,How do you think so.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;16;04;17,01;16;26;08,It seems like they have a I know there's a family that comes. They had some meetings here in Grange Hall on Sunday and I think they have five little ones. Harry Wharton he she needs one. He carries one little brother. So it looks like they're like the bigger families like you. So I don't know. But it's your cost an awful lot.
Charlene Olson,01;16;26;08,01;16;27;03,A lot of.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;16;27;03,01;16;32;15,Money to raise them because she was so close or so expensive.
Charlene Olson,01;16;32;17,01;16;38;05,"And back in your days I think different people make do more. I mean, like you saw in your parents."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;16;38;11,01;16;41;11,They don't have time for that now because they work.
Charlene Olson,01;16;41;12,01;16;42;11,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;16;42;13,01;16;50;04,"And I don't think any of these younger married women do anything because they don't have time, because they're working. They got to keep their job."
Charlene Olson,01;16;50;06,01;16;54;14,Did you sew your clothes even entirely once you got older?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;16;55;00,01;17;02;23,"when I went to bed, it was going to go to the camps. And that's why I sewed my dresses for my clothes to take with me."
Charlene Olson,01;17;02;26,01;17;04;07,What about since you were married?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;17;04;13,01;17;10;12,"Oh, yeah. I get all the time. Until just now. Like the later years."
Charlene Olson,01;17;10;14,01;17;20;11,"Well, let me see if there's anything I can. You think of anything that might be interesting about, your early life or my first?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;17;20;13,01;17;26;07,"Oh, I don't know."
Charlene Olson,01;17;26;10,01;17;34;16,"I'll look and see if I, I'll. Okay. My phone."
Charlene Olson,01;17;34;19,01;17;41;20,"When you had your boys, what did you do with the family for any recreation? Or was there any time for that third thing?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;17;41;23,01;18;04;14,"Well, we, We bought us an old model T for the cars from our market, Ford. And we ride around the country, and we drive around and go out in the woods, so. And we go huckleberry picking going up Saturday night. Stay overnight, sleep on the ground and, and go pick up."
Charlene Olson,01;18;04;14,01;18;06;05,You better care for.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;18;06;16,01;18;08;21,no I know some

Charlene Olson,01;18;31;26,01;18;36;11,"Oh nice. Then you could, listen to things at home."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;18;36;18,01;18;48;21,Yeah. That radio runs. Yeah. Because we are up here not very long. Usually I got here.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;18;48;23,01;18;50;27,"Somebody else is, you know."
Charlene Olson,01;18;51;00,01;18;54;06,"Oh, you mean, like, all things you have? Yeah."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;18;54;13,01;18;58;14,"Well, it was, Oh, everything that I didn't want."
Charlene Olson,01;18;58;19,01;18;59;13,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;18;59;15,01;19;01;02,It's all kinds of junk.
Charlene Olson,01;19;01;03,01;19;01;25,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;19;01;27,01;19;04;12,"And and the, So the wood stove."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;19;05;01,01;19;13;11,"It's been sitting there in that basement for many years there. I think it was there. When we come there, and I got $105."
Charlene Olson,01;19;13;12,01;19;16;20,"For it, I was going to say a lot of those old things are really worth quite a bit of."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;19;16;20,01;19;34;24,"Money. And I was up in the house that opened the door. The basement was just full of people put their stuff and they couldn't just leave it right there. And the basement and and I thought and I heard a baby and I thought, oh no, the next door was rusty. So I tried to clean it off."
Charlene Olson,01;19;34;26,01;19;36;05,All the rest.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;19;36;08,01;19;42;23,And after all that's terrible. And I got nervous over it or what.
Charlene Olson,01;19;42;25,01;19;59;05,"Right. Right. Yeah. well, that's the way it is with all of your things. My. When my grandma died, my mother, people, you know, they all had a sale. She says now I, I sometimes wish I would never have so many things go but."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;19;59;08,01;20;00;01,Well yeah.
Charlene Olson,01;20;01;09,01;20;03;03,"you know, cause things like that."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;20;03;04,01;20;06;05,But it's just this last year now that those sales come in.
Charlene Olson,01;20;06;08,01;20;06;22,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;20;06;26,01;20;27;06,"Now, when my mother left her house over there, she lived two years in my apartment basement there before we took her to the nursing home. Then they didn't have sales, and we let the secondhand man come up with what he wanted, and. And then what he didn't want with that. Was it because there was no. Nobody wanted to buy it."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;20;27;06,01;20;31;13,There was just this last year they had started buying fabric stuff and old stuff.
Charlene Olson,01;20;31;14,01;20;32;21,That's really pretty.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;20;32;23,01;21;01;16,"Yeah, that to the house here. but I had baskets in there. I had them in a box. And then, I took them to the sale, although I thought I can get, I thought I had, and I took the five aside to the sale, and I was going to six when I come home, I took them out of the box, and I thought they were $6 apiece."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;21;01;22,01;21;07;05,They're going to be here. I got $6 apiece. I got $30 for five.
Charlene Olson,01;21;07;07,01;21;16;23,"They're beautiful. They're lovely. I wonder where they're, where they were made, but, boy, they're pretty rare. They a wedding present?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;21;16;24,01;21;26;29,"No. Not you. But, I know I can sell and order wedding dresses but I, I, I well I'm not going to drag on leather a dozen of these."
Charlene Olson,01;21;26;29,01;21;27;09,Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;21;27;09,01;21;29;13,No because I got five year.
Unknown,01;21;29;15,01;21;35;03,And a half for them. But I got a lot of my wedding presents.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;21;35;05,01;21;45;01,"Where's our cargo. Oh yeah. Those. Here's one more of our, of our old wedding."
Charlene Olson,01;21;45;03,01;21;47;07,Did you get an idea.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;21;47;09,01;21;49;23,In Grange Hall? Oh.
Charlene Olson,01;21;49;25,01;21;58;18,"Or. Yeah. What? Have you ever. Have you found the biggest, adjustment to be alone after being married to someone for long?"
Ella Lillian Olson,01;21;58;18,01;22;12;15,"Oh, I don't know. Just goes there. Now, that's my sister. There's my sisters. Oh, the only child that she can. And they got all those boys."
Charlene Olson,01;22;12;18,01;22;14;18,"Oh, my goodness, they're."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;22;14;21,01;22;25;24,"Six and they're 22 at this point. And so then when the last one, she's going to have the last one where we said, it's just got to be a girl. And there was."
Charlene Olson,01;22;25;26,01;22;26;15,A boy.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;22;26;15,01;22;48;09,"Another boy. so she had shipped, they had six, and the twins, the one twin is going to school in Moscow. And then he's been in the Navy and he's getting schooling, and his wife goes to school, too. And I have a twin. It's in the year course in the guard. The National Guard. Something down on the coast."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;22;49;01,01;23;09;23,"And he's married. And one of the boys is married and lives in, Spokane. And he has two boys and and then the other one goes to school in Nampa there, and one is going to go take a college and, and the other one is finishing high school."
Charlene Olson,01;23;09;25,01;23;11;22,If that's your boy during the war.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;23;11;24,01;23;13;03,Yeah.
Charlene Olson,01;23;13;06,01;23;14;20,Yeah. He sent out for him last.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;23;14;22,01;23;20;05,Year during the war. Let's take another one to come here.
Charlene Olson,01;23;20;08,01;23;22;01,He the one that was hurt.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;23;22;04,01;23;46;01,"No, no that's the one. That's several stories. And he looks just like that too. If you ever going to search through around have you just. Yeah I miss him because he said look he looks just like he never changed. And he's 54. And that's my mother up there that was in the paper. Oh. And when."
Charlene Olson,01;23;46;01,01;23;56;25,When you got married. and what did the girls expect from marriage then. Did they just expect that they would get married and have a bunch of children?
Ella Lillian Olson,01;23;56;25,01;23;59;26,"And I don't know what they call it, but."
Charlene Olson,01;23;59;28,01;24;02;22,"You know what you expected or what you expect. Well, I."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;24;02;22,01;24;04;20,Expect there'll be a house full of kids.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;24;05;07,01;24;07;10,So I figured I'm going to try to get it home.
Charlene Olson,01;24;07;10,01;24;09;06,There was no harm in it. Yeah.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;24;09;08,01;24;12;26,And I didn't want that may work accident.
Charlene Olson,01;24;12;28,01;24;17;27,"I wanted to a lot of times, the oldest one. You have to take care of so many younger."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;24;17;29,01;24;19;06,Than you say. I'm tired.
Charlene Olson,01;24;19;06,01;24;22;01,"Of that. When you get married, then you don't want to have them."
Ella Lillian Olson,01;24;22;03,01;24;38;24,"And the three youngest works at home were boys. And I said, I sure don't want any boys. and I got two of them. Yeah. So I had sense enough to quit, I guess. So I didn't have sex anyway. Yeah."
Charlene Olson,01;24;38;27,01;24;43;18,Right. Sometimes that happens. She could have more and they could hear me boy.
Ella Lillian Olson,01;24;43;18,01;24;49;28,Yeah. But that's. That's enough.
