And they don't have a Catholic church provided church, their community church."
Lillian Thompson,00;24;19;03,00;24;23;26,But I just don't. I guess I should and shouldn't feel.
Unknown Interviewer,00;24;23;26,00;24;26;12,Learning right at the moment. That isn't.

Unknown Interviewer,00;26;49;10,00;26;52;17,Is that just relaxing here can be very interesting.
Lillian Thompson,00;26;52;18,00;26;58;06,"Well, we moved out here because we just thought it'd be great happening here with work."
Unknown,00;26;58;06,00;27;04;11,At that time. so that's why we get.
Unknown Interviewer,00;27;05;09,00;27;14;02,Correct. Do you know any women who live in an urban area? Big city. Would you? How would you compare your live there?

Unknown Interviewer,00;27;17;20,00;27;17;24,That.
Lillian Thompson,00;27;17;24,00;27;21;11,For your.
Lillian Thompson,00;27;21;14,00;27;38;26,"And she doesn't like this country at all. She runs everything right at the touch of her finger, you know, press the button here, button there. Everything is smart enough to date, but she doesn't like everything's up here because we live according to."
Unknown Interviewer,00;27;38;28,00;27;41;24,Would you like to live like she can? No.
Lillian Thompson,00;27;41;26,00;27;50;03,I don't like. Yeah. I wouldn't change my life for all of California.
Lillian Thompson,00;27;51;01,00;28;02;12,"No, I don't think I would care if it moved down there. I just don't care for that. I've been through Los Angeles, but as far as, like, a baby."
Unknown,00;28;02;15,00;28;08;11,"No, I would never."
Unknown Interviewer,00;28;08;13,00;28;20;05,"how did, when your children grew up, how was their life different from yours when you were growing up? I wasn't about to say. Well."
Lillian Thompson,00;28;20;07,00;28;40;22,"Our children more or less had to work, but, you know, we made of get jobs and help with the income. I didn't feel it was right and that I could grow up and not have have something to do, do. And then when they were in school, when you're going to in high school, they earned their own money and got their own."
Lillian Thompson,00;28;40;22,00;28;52;14,"The college. But Marilyn Monroe was terrible, but she had a job, but she could, you know, live it up and not have to work for what her."
Unknown Interviewer,00;28;52;14,00;28;56;05,Different from other children in the neighborhood.
Lillian Thompson,00;28;56;07,00;29;24;29,"I think her voice. yeah. I think our boys got more of a big job than other boys. Really? I think they did what they could best known that I think they were. And then the other big thing, because a lot of the parents had the money to give their children where we just didn't have. You know, where my husband worked for all his life, for the girls."
Lillian Thompson,00;29;25;01,00;29;30;04,"Well, you get paid when they stay home in the long."
Unknown Interviewer,00;29;30;07,00;29;35;28,They sound like you probably would have required them to have responsibilities even if you'd been able to.
Lillian Thompson,00;29;35;28,00;30;08;21,"Afford. Yes. I feel that any child growing up could have responsibility and part of their development that I mean that to me. I think that's what's wrong with for most the children today is the parents give giving $10 per hour going out and find something to do. Now this is I have the same situation with my sister up there in Spokane, though they her children were very different than ours and they have more income."
Lillian Thompson,00;30;08;24,00;30;21;04,"But her husband had a better job and a steady income. But I know understand what the difference. But really, in comparison, our children turned out just as good, if not better. Since I was on the money."
Unknown Interviewer,00;30;21;06,00;30;26;00,I think I could have maybe some advantages for having had that experience at work.
Lillian Thompson,00;30;26;03,00;30;51;08,"If they went to college, their children had the chance to go to college for our boys. Did they learn what they they're building? Their jobs today? They learned the hard way. Okay. So I guess working at it. So I feel like in a long way, they didn't need a college education to get where they are today."
Unknown Interviewer,00;30;51;11,00;30;54;00,And you feel like they did as well. Yeah.
Lillian Thompson,00;30;54;02,00;30;56;13,I think our youngest son.
Unknown Interviewer,00;30;56;15,00;30;57;19,Is in the Caribbean.
Lillian Thompson,00;30;57;20,00;31;28;10,"He started out when he was 14 years old. He took Mastercard down the filling station and he came from there, try to work on up, change, big trip cars and all night. He liked mechanics. They worked on their own car and overhauled their cars, and they grown up in both. The boys are real good at mechanic. They don't take their cars into a garage that works out to them."
Unknown Interviewer,00;31;28;12,00;31;40;11,"So that's very good. So you know, today you're going to, pretty much the way you were. You grew up with this kind of experience where."
Lillian Thompson,00;31;40;16,00;31;57;27,"Yeah, we I didn't know, you know, we had to learn things at hand and we had to learn to drive when we were real young. I remember when I was only about six, I'm only been about 6 or 7 years old. I go out in the field with my dad. See, we are no."
Unknown Interviewer,00;31;57;27,00;31;58;06,Ma'am.
Lillian Thompson,00;31;58;07,00;32;19;15,"He truck, you know, and it's the time that you put in the collection early to get it to go on where we get this thing of going inside before I get to the gate, all they're doing shut off the keys. But I graduated from the field and cabins I could connect. I got to, I couldn't shift and or anything."
Lillian Thompson,00;32;19;15,00;32;30;13,"All it did was just start putting over here. well, how many kids did this kid do? Things like that?"
Unknown Interviewer,00;32;30;15,00;32;32;12,Right. They have to get a license in order to learn.

Unknown Interviewer,00;32;37;12,00;32;47;20,"all right, some of the things I've already talked about. Some things you just spent working or what did you have? Recreation. What'd you do for recreation?"
Lillian Thompson,00;32;47;22,00;33;12;10,"Well, we belong to both. My sister and I belong on the basketball team. You know, for four years through high school. And then we cook baseball, and we had a regular club to school. That team, you know, at over at and Stanley. And they had rooms and horses. So we weren't lacking for things to do."
Unknown Interviewer,00;33;12;12,00;33;16;01,but you did have time for records here. An opportunity.

Lillian Thompson,00;33;31;12,00;34;00;11,"That that was pretty scary for the boys. Be careful for school. Now, if there's something to be done, like they would take money from school when those girls are. Okay, but we lots of time, you know, to go into basketball games or something like that. We had to ride horses five miles. So seven something different. Yeah. You know, five miles from school."
Unknown Interviewer,00;34;00;13,00;34;02;19,Did you ever walk over here?
Lillian Thompson,00;34;02;19,00;34;10;21,"And many a time we walked home from school. We didn't have to walk in the mornings to go to school, but we walked in."
Unknown Interviewer,00;34;10;23,00;34;12;03,With someone taking in.

You know, it could be the pulling any of that but a crock just a minute on that rail or I, the whole family's been killed. There was a Caucasus birthday, I birthday it was.

I was that carried. After that, every one of those kids would go climb under the bed and the train would go to go it it just it scared of the death."
Unknown Interviewer,00;35;47;20,00;35;55;17,To come on the back of the day. Yeah. What did you think when your children were growing up? What kind of recreation?

They were more down to earth people, and they were hard to figure out what they were as far doing things for people that think this community is so wonderful, you know, and they will help people. Now there happens to be a flier or something."
Lillian Thompson,00;38;29;21,00;38;53;21,"They will go ahead and make that thing. You know, they go somewhere and do things for the family.
