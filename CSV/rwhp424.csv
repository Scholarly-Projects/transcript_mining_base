Gertrude Hudson,00;13;01;17,00;13;46;19,"That's just a little bit higher. we went into things like that for, because the were we learned about the source of the river, the Mount Hood River and how water runs down here and that type of thing that, about soil laid it down the farm road. of course, that was interesting for them. And why they also talked about the, plowing, a contour, because they had frozen so that the soil would wash."
Unknown Interviewer,00;13;46;24,00;13;54;02,"Most of the children that you raised, I mean, not raised, excuse me, but, taught were farm children that were just."

They said they didn't know whether they would keep the mill or not. that they would know by a certain date. Well, I left for a week in Moscow, and so everybody registered and went to school, and I was staying at the dormitory with."
Gertrude Hudson,00;19;35;24,00;19;56;11,"And I didn't know whether I was going to register or not. So I knew the days were going to be very long. So I went over and got a correspondence course and wrote up the correspondence course, and, and that what, that first week or in three grades, first week of school."

Unknown Interviewer,00;21;21;02,00;21;22;18,"Room and board, you have to pay."
Gertrude Hudson,00;21;22;22,00;21;38;16,"I oh, it was very cheap. I think that we paid about about $25 a month for board. And I think our room, it was about $5 a month."
Unknown Interviewer,00;21;38;19,00;21;39;28,And you had to earn that?
Gertrude Hudson,00;21;40;05,00;21;43;21,Oh no. My family and the family there.

The, semester ended in June, and they had a summer school session that started right after that. And so I took the maximum amount of work for my masters. And then in the summer school, I had my masters work, my thesis all done, and my end credits."
Gertrude Hudson,00;22;17;19,00;23;04;13,"Oh, that. But I like two weeks a residence because there was overlapping. And so I had to have 18. No, I had to have 36. Well, I didn't have that. But two weeks and I had. Decided that I would stay right after summer school and I'd do an extra course, or that I would come back at Christmas time and put in my two weeks Christmas vacation, because I had to go up to campus those two weeks, near the end of summer school, the university put on a play and I went to the play."
Gertrude Hudson,00;23;04;13,00;23;34;29,"And then after the plane went downtown, the ice cream parlor, were eating there and a very good friend of mine had been in the play, and I got but the crowd, I was off and went over until it was nice job she could pick her up. And, she was very pleased. And as I was going back to my friends, the messenger certainly."

So then he offered me a teaching fellowship for the next year. So I went back to school and put in the whole year. And so I had a lot of extra credits for my masters."
Gertrude Hudson,00;24;05;17,00;24;35;13,"And my father insisted that on take take the Teaching fellowship, because my brother had been offered the fellowship of being on from the grant realm.

Gertrude Hudson,00;24;35;16,00;25;01;28,I said that he feel that the family could afford to because my younger brother was coming up for him to go to. So we should have a chance. he always kind of regretted the fact that he had made that decision. I had this chance. My dad says you have to come. There's one member of the family here.
Gertrude Hudson,00;25;02;01,00;25;16;23,"I regret not getting a master's degree, and I'm not going to have to live. So I went and I really enjoyed very, very much."

Gertrude Hudson,01;22;15;08,01;22;41;15,"In here. I thought I was in the other building, from the door downstairs to the door, going to school. It's just 100 steps. Just one and six. And my mother just loved it. The kids were. And she often regretted the fact that when I was a kid that they didn't have in school colors for school, cause as the kids had to go."
Unknown Interviewer,01;22;41;17,01;23;01;21,"There's been there's been a lot of changes, in the town. Okay, a lot of things. But you feel that the values are all changed. what do you what do you really see for, like, you said you had that one niece that has a daughter. What do you think? For the there like the here."
Unknown,01;23;01;21,01;23;08;13,But but things are changing for women. Well.
Gertrude Hudson,01;23;08;16,01;23;47;16,"I don't know, because now I have never felt inhibited. And I grew up in the, neighborhood, but there were all boys. So I played with the boys. My older brother, who's two years, almost two years older than I wanted to play. He taught me to catch. He taught me to back, and he taught me to run. one, practice for me so that I was as good or better than any of the, the boys."
Gertrude Hudson,01;23;47;18,01;24;22;06,"And then we're choosing upside for baseball. This, if you can be the last one, move up. Don't get the last, last one. so, I had a very special privilege there because my brother wanted me to excel and to do things. he took the time to to train school so that I competed with them. And I never, failed a bond girl relationship."
Gertrude Hudson,01;24;22;11,01;24;37;22,"Now, that may be one of the reasons why I married when I was younger. Because I'm not all the fellows on there on Brown and Girl and I. I think that I like boys better than I."
Unknown Interviewer,01;24;37;22,01;24;38;27,Do.
Gertrude Hudson,01;24;38;29,01;24;53;22,"Girls. And so I was growing up and particularly then in high school because, it seemed to me that the girls always wanted to be away to on I think that was my husband."
Unknown Interviewer,01;24;53;24,01;24;54;25,Weren't like that.
Gertrude Hudson,01;24;54;28,01;25;12;16,"Often. I was in my career. I, competed with my brothers and the neighbor boys, and I just felt like one of them. I could build a boat, I could swim as well as they could. I could skate as well as they could. I could do."
Unknown Interviewer,01;25;12;18,01;25;14;19,And that just carried on to your later life.
Gertrude Hudson,01;25;14;19,01;25;31;28,"And and, I never felt I've never had a job that anybody wanted to do. When I started in, in a club, I know I'd either do it, do it well, or be a complete person."
Unknown Interviewer,01;25;32;00,01;25;37;01,And you knew your limits and you knew your needs so much at home.
Gertrude Hudson,01;25;37;02,01;25;40;11,So? So I just.
Unknown Interviewer,01;25;40;14,01;25;56;28,"You were. You just want part. You just didn't. You felt like, some of the girls that you grew up were just kind of, some not submitting. That's not the word I went, but just kind of playing the role or,"
Gertrude Hudson,01;25;57;01,01;26;23;12,"Where I didn't meet up until I was in high school. Because in a small town where everyone knows everybody else, you just kind of go on and I want to finish the question. So I wasn't playing musical with my family, wanted to make music, presents, a lot of questions. And I did all of things with the girls here."
Gertrude Hudson,01;26;24;07,01;26;31;21,"and I could compete with them, and I could compete with the boys. And I liked to compete with the boys, but it didn't to,"
Unknown Interviewer,01;26;31;23,01;26;36;29,"You just you just felt like you were different. And that you wanted to do. No, I."
Gertrude Hudson,01;26;36;29,01;26;37;22,Didn't feel different.
Unknown Interviewer,01;26;37;24,01;26;43;06,You didn't feel different?
Unknown Interviewer,01;26;43;08,01;27;11;25,"But, I didn't mean that as a performer. but it seems like in high school, it's the starts of being where, you start playing mobile interaction games. But you know what I mean, boys, it was supposed to make the boys understand. the girls are supposed to be cool, and, you know, and you never felt like that."
Unknown Interviewer,01;27;12;02,01;27;13;02,You know.
Gertrude Hudson,01;27;13;05,01;27;42;29,"I never had to make a play for attention to get the boys tension. I created them just. And just. Just like. Like I treated my brother. but there was just no covering up to to anybody, that way. So that I guess I missed out on something, feminine. Where's that? That might."
Unknown Interviewer,01;27;43;05,01;28;02;18,"Have. But you don't have to apologize if you're like, you've seen so many areas of the world, but I'm wrong. You said that if you had to do it all over again, how would you do it differently? You know, I asked you a little while ago what you would advise someone like me to do, but I can never do it again."
Unknown Interviewer,01;28;02;18,01;28;05;16,What? What things would you change?
Gertrude Hudson,01;28;05;18,01;28;11;02,"Well, I think perhaps."
Gertrude Hudson,01;28;13;12,01;28;27;29,Maybe I wouldn't have stopped going to school. talk. go to school and talk. Teach and go to school. I think I would have told McDonald up going right straight. The four is.
Unknown Interviewer,01;28;28;01,01;28;37;13,"In College Park, you know, up front, just, sort of fumbling around a little bit. You would have just gone right and started and gone."
Gertrude Hudson,01;28;37;13,01;28;58;11,"And I ran. I, I had a wonderful time. I did everything I could, I my, I sometimes think that I would perhaps have liked, should have gotten married when I was younger and had a family. You because I, I."
Unknown Interviewer,01;28;58;14,01;29;10;02,"Wish that maybe that it would have changed. But I didn't. Do you think that might have inhibited some of your wanting to travel and some of these feelings, though."
Gertrude Hudson,01;29;10;04,01;29;38;14,"Perhaps it would have, because if I got married at the time when I should have got married, when it then just lived through the depression, and I don't know what that might have had in store. I'm awfully glad that I was on my own and had, a good job and was able to weather that without,"
Unknown Interviewer,01;29;38;16,01;29;41;06,"Like you said, that was one of the better times of your life."
Gertrude Hudson,01;29;41;06,01;30;06;07,"That was one that I did more during that time that I had been able to do up on at any other time. And first, I am one of those people that I. You pay your way and you go along and you take care of your the things that you have and you do the best that you possibly can."
Gertrude Hudson,01;30;06;09,01;30;12;03,You do the best with and for your friends that you possibly can. you always.
Unknown,01;30;12;03,01;30;20;12,Remember your family and all.
Unknown,01;30;20;15,01;30;21;29,And I.
Gertrude Hudson,01;30;22;01,01;30;37;05,I don't like this feeling of death. Living on a. Pottery car. credit card.
Gertrude Hudson,01;30;37;07,01;31;16;19,"I never once, but once had anyone ask me about, for a check from a school and boys. My father sent me a check. I was going to ask. My brother was in Washington state and check for $35 for my dad and I. One stopped at a little grocery store in northwestern and wanted to him. Or at least I was, and the grocer and said, well, I would have to write him and see what a restaurant you had that much money in the bank."
Gertrude Hudson,01;31;16;22,01;31;45;26,"I looked at it and I said, if you don't think this will be $35, the bank took the road down the depot and I knew the deposit use and no cash checks or they didn't have that. And and I walked up to the window, just as cold as could be, and met the man if he would cash my check on my son to run the country and springs that I wanted to go to Pullman."
Gertrude Hudson,01;31;45;26,01;32;16;26,"My brother was going to Washington State, and I wandered off for Campus Day, and he looked at the check and he said, oh. This is so sure. How so he passed the check and I went up to the Pullman for campus fame. My brother, my train was coming, so that was the only time I ever had anybody question a check."
Unknown Interviewer,01;32;16;28,01;32;43;01,"And so, like, one of the first things in your life and I think you have to do right by everyone, you know. But the attitude, do you think it's the atmosphere of the whole United States is changing towards the values of the place? Or is it just, the area as you see right here in this area or what?"
Unknown Interviewer,01;32;43;04,01;32;46;27,"Well, it's making people change. I don't, I don't."
Gertrude Hudson,01;32;46;29,01;33;11;25,I don't not making people change. But I think it's too much keeping up with the Joneses and wanting to to do things and living beyond their means and constantly worrying whether or not they can make their payments. I think that must be a terrific strain. people. Or it has to be out.
Unknown,01;33;12;02,01;33;23;18,"And I don't care attitude. and I'm concerned because,"
Unknown Interviewer,01;33;23;20,01;33;24;28,I'm under.
Unknown,01;33;25;04,01;33;31;25,area of southern Idaho. so it seems to I'd like to cook a little bit.
Unknown Interviewer,01;33;31;25,01;33;44;01,"And that's what this woman's project is to, to keep, to keep them the old and to change for the better of the new, to get the best of both sides, I think."
Gertrude Hudson,01;33;44;01,01;34;04;21,"So, I think a firm faith in God and a firm faith and manner. Now, I some I have known in my life of all, have a chance to express themselves and to do the things that they wanted to, to do."
Unknown Interviewer,01;34;06;17,01;34;20;05,"so you feel that each woman's really had her own chance, that she's made her own? Yeah. Right. Yeah. You don't think that, some men are harder to live with them and dominate them a little bit?"
Gertrude Hudson,01;34;20;11,01;34;38;03,"Oh, I'm sure that a lot of women haven't had a chance to express themselves because their men have them more or less kind of people that they lose connection with. The lives didn't become."
