You're back. now we have a list of questions that we asked more or less, to stimulate, your thought and to remind you of things. and if you, certainly if there's some there that you don't want to answer.

You know, they each each teacher has, has a niche where as you get, like, you know, when I went to University of Utah to teach, I always felt like I was just. I was, you know, an important cog here. And you get down there and you're just like, a little screw down at the bottom of the barrel."
Alba Libera Marra,00:20:35:01,00:20:36:02,"There's this, that loss."
Unknown Interviewer,00:20:36:06,00:20:37:27,So you really don't feel like you don't it?
Alba Libera Marra,00:20:37:28,00:20:46:17,"No, no. That's it. It's just, you have more of a chance to, to get ahead in a smaller community. They appreciate."
Unknown Interviewer,00:20:46:17,00:20:47:26,You more. Yeah.
Alba Libera Marra,00:20:47:28,00:21:08:00,"That's. Yeah. Like, I got a letter from my cousin yesterday, and she said we didn't know we had such an infant. I said we read it the way she wrote it. Such an important relative who got, the newspaper for free in a bigger city. You wouldn't that you wouldn't make the right. You would make the newspaper."
Unknown Interviewer,00:21:08:02,00:21:10:26,Come and go over here for.
Alba Libera Marra,00:21:10:28,00:21:30:28,"Figuring it out. Right. That's and it's embarrassing. I mean, but then it. And when, Jeannette Young came, you know, and wanted to interview. You don't know what to do but tell it's still part of, you ought to society if you can, help out. That's the way to do it, right? That's the way I grew up."
Alba Libera Marra,00:21:30:29,00:21:33:17,"I told you the last night, you know."
Unknown Interviewer,00:21:33:19,00:21:37:16,"A lot of, just modeling for for children coming up."
Alba Libera Marra,00:21:37:16,00:21:38:07,That's right.
Unknown Interviewer,00:21:38:10,00:21:39:22,How to succeed as a key.
Alba Libera Marra,00:21:39:22,00:21:40:25,That's right.
Unknown Interviewer,00:21:40:27,00:21:41:19,They're observing.
Alba Libera Marra,00:21:41:19,00:21:44:05,"No, that's just, you know, that's what you have to."
Unknown Interviewer,00:21:44:05,00:21:56:22,"Witness for for children and people. I recommend how well you've already gotten into it, comparing the life. And that's the significance."
Alba Libera Marra,00:21:56:24,00:22:24:25,"You know, when we when I was five, my parents went to California, to Sacramento. They had decided that, we wanted to get out from, you know, under in the mines and, in the smelter, and he'd try a new life. So they went to, Sacramento first, and then from Sacramento, after six months in Sacramento, we went to Stanford, Cisco, and then we came back to see everything."
Alba Libera Marra,00:22:24:25,00:22:45:08,"They had not sold their home there. So then they still we still had a home. Then again, he got the urge in, mother wanted to go to Italy to see her folks, but he decided that he, that he wanted to not have to work anymore. He was going to, make a living off of the farm."
Alba Libera Marra,00:22:45:10,00:23:14:16,"So they went to, Washington, to Prosser, Washington. And, while there on the farm, they we had, an apple orchard and, he broke his leg. So it was up to mother to take care of the farm. It was up to mother to, to milk the cows. I had chickenpox when I was there. It was, that was, my first experience in, they had lunch program."
Alba Libera Marra,00:23:14:16,00:23:42:10,"I mean, I'm digressing here, but you get it. You got into that hot lunch program, and, I can remember that even then, some youngsters were getting free lunch. The children across the street, their income, because they had lived on the farm longer and were gradually losing everything. They were allowed to have free lunches, whereas my parents had just come in, I had to pay for my lunch."
Alba Libera Marra,00:23:42:10,00:24:02:00,"And, you know, I often wondered about that. And when, when I grew up and so working in just a little room school there and there, we had we brought soup to school. It was our turn to bring soup. And then we youngsters took turns cooking the soup and making the soup for the rest of the youngsters to eat."
Alba Libera Marra,00:24:02:02,00:24:13:09,"And that was, you know, the contrast between, going to a two room school. And then I went, you know, to the what we called. Well, it's a farming community, but it was a city to me."
Unknown Interviewer,00:24:14:26,00:24:15:29,But that was good.
Alba Libera Marra,00:24:16:02,00:24:19:09,But it's just good experience. Just the just to see the differences.
Unknown Interviewer,00:24:19:13,00:24:30:07,"Yeah. Oh, so you're traveling through there? Oh. what? How old were you when you went through the where you brought soup and prepared for others for that?"
Alba Libera Marra,00:24:30:07,00:24:56:12,"That was, when I went to silver cooking school from grade one through, 36. But I went to Prosser in the third grade, and I, made the. So I missed the fifth or sixth grade I made in one year. So we just took turns as the older children, you know, would make the soup on the big, pot bellied stove."
Alba Libera Marra,00:24:56:12,00:25:06:19,"You know, you you heated your soup on there. So that was the beginning of a lunch program, but a hot lunch. But you had your you brought your own sandwiches, but you had then your hot soup."
Unknown Interviewer,00:25:09:00,00:25:09:26,"Very, very."
Alba Libera Marra,00:25:09:29,00:25:16:22,"Worst I could picture. I wish I had a picture of that school. Yeah, that was up the upper Dalton. So pretty."
Unknown Interviewer,00:25:16:22,00:25:20:14,Good. Each child I have don't bore us.
Alba Libera Marra,00:25:20:14,00:25:42:09,"We have really, took care of and took care of, washing them all. So we got some housekeeping duties in there, and then the teacher, my very first sewing experience was when I was in the fourth grade down there. And, the teacher had us, so towels and work and towels and do things like that."
Alba Libera Marra,00:25:42:12,00:25:52:21,"So in the early the earlier time teacher, you know, brought in more the domestic, aspects than the that you don't get in the schools nowadays."
Unknown Interviewer,00:25:52:24,00:25:54:27,But it was related to something that was neat.
Alba Libera Marra,00:25:55:01,00:25:56:12,Work that was needed to.
Unknown Interviewer,00:25:56:12,00:25:57:00,Motivate.
Alba Libera Marra,00:25:57:00,00:26:05:13,"That's right. And we had the towels and we had the towels and then the towels were used for, wiping our dishes and all."
Unknown Interviewer,00:26:05:15,00:26:06:10,"That, that we."
Alba Libera Marra,00:26:06:10,00:26:08:21,All had to do something.
Unknown Interviewer,00:26:09:00,00:26:22:14,I like to work. Go back a little bit to the time your father broke his leg and your mother took over that work on her arm. there's. That's one thing we want to get recorded. How the women came here. Yes.
Alba Libera Marra,00:26:22:16,00:26:22:28,Absolutely.
Unknown Interviewer,00:26:23:01,00:26:27:04,That's right. And there was no question then about her not being able.
Alba Libera Marra,00:26:27:04,00:26:49:29,"Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. There. And our farm was divided when, she talked about the jungle area. The, the one speaker last night and our farm was divided, a half of our farm was on one side of the railroad track and the road, the tracks that went to Walla Walla and the other, the other side was the other part, the ranch."
Alba Libera Marra,00:26:49:29,00:27:17:13,"The trees were on the other area. And that, in in Sprague, this one incident, what? Sprained. a mother would always see the snakes. We believed there was a canal on this side of our farm. And right across the canal were all the rattlesnakes. But rattlesnakes somehow or other didn't cross the canal and come to our area."
Alba Libera Marra,00:27:17:15,00:27:41:10,"But the. But, mother, I. Every time she went out to the orchard, she always saw the snakes. The dad didn't see yes or no one else did. So one day they were out there and screen and, mother's head was helping to spray, and she grabbed the cane and started hitting. And the fellas go break my cane, don't break my cane purchases where there's a smell."
Alba Libera Marra,00:27:41:13,00:27:45:23,And they really believed it. Them that she was seeing the the snake.
Alba Libera Marra,00:27:47:05,00:28:16:05,"And then now and, going back to the jungle, there there were that, that was my, recollection of being afraid. The, the bandits or the tramps, as you know, the the other speaker spoke, we'd go by, the, on the railroad tracks, and then they would knock at the door. And many a time we would just close the door and just run and hide and just be real quiet, because mother would be alone, and mother and I alone."
Alba Libera Marra,00:28:16:05,00:28:19:14,"And she was afraid, you know, to to let anybody in."
Alba Libera Marra,00:28:20:20,00:28:21:19,So excessively.
Unknown Interviewer,00:28:21:19,00:28:22:01,Asking.
Alba Libera Marra,00:28:22:01,00:28:34:25,"For asking for. They were asking for food dances in because they were hopping the trains there. There was the station just down below, and then they'd get off and then hop to, get food and hop the train and go off."
Unknown Interviewer,00:28:34:28,00:28:37:06,So anybody who lived near her got a lot.
Alba Libera Marra,00:28:37:07,00:29:02:04,"Of time and I, I don't know, this would go into the record and then this Farm Bureau, they didn't have an outhouse, but the, the outhouse was in the, was it under the covering in the in the shed and yet. But, if you had a bucket, you had a bucket in this, under the hole there."
Alba Libera Marra,00:29:02:06,00:29:29:12,"And then my dad, emptied it and it was entered into the canal. But when dad became ill, then it was mother's, duty that she had to take that and go and empty. But that's that's see, because now it's so recurring. We had the outhouse there, but, yeah, we had the modern facility, but we went from there to the to the more primitive."
Unknown Interviewer,00:29:29:14,00:29:32:08,"Now, this canal was used for irrigating irrigation."
Alba Libera Marra,00:29:32:08,00:29:40:29,"Yeah. That's that this was the huge canal that went through. And then the people, you know, took, got their water that that came on in for irrigated."
Alba Libera Marra,00:29:42:11,00:29:48:29,But I read for just isn't that horrid. A person goes back into their old memories.
Unknown Interviewer,00:29:49:21,00:29:50:27,But I think that's it.
Alba Libera Marra,00:29:51:00,00:29:52:27,That's it. Because that's different.
Unknown Interviewer,00:29:54:03,00:29:57:07,I think with that. Do you think they did that in Italy?
Alba Libera Marra,00:29:57:10,00:30:11:09,"I don't think most of this was the the farm. That was something. Oh no no oh no, oh no no, this was the farm that this was the way the farm was when we moved here. And we stayed there just for one year doing this. Yes."
Unknown Interviewer,00:30:11:11,00:30:13:04,That's right. When you had a.
Alba Libera Marra,00:30:13:05,00:30:29:05,"Pet right up there, left, right. Because you couldn't, you couldn't dig there, see, because of the water that was. See. Yes. See, there was no your there was no way that you could, you could dig down because there was, there was the water in your."
Unknown Interviewer,00:30:29:05,00:30:29:21,Table where.
Alba Libera Marra,00:30:29:21,00:30:42:21,"The water came. And so you couldn't. And until that was the one way this, whoever had the place before we bought it had, and whoever had the other place did anything."
Unknown Interviewer,00:30:42:23,00:30:45:29,"Boom. We lived in Taiwan, and that."
Alba Libera Marra,00:30:46:01,00:30:47:09,"Was that, too."
Unknown Interviewer,00:30:47:11,00:30:56:04,"We had, a woman. Well, actually, we're nearby. Farmers came in and took it back, and they'd have kids ready, ripe and get prepared."
Alba Libera Marra,00:30:56:07,00:31:08:01,"You know? No, this was just wasted here. We went to home and we were right on the road so that it was easy just to go up on the bridge and,"
Unknown Interviewer,00:31:08:03,00:31:11:03,Got it. So. But your mother pitched in.
Alba Libera Marra,00:31:11:03,00:31:12:15,"Oh, yes. Oh."
Unknown Interviewer,00:31:12:17,00:31:16:19,"Oh, yeah. Along with your father incapacitated. Oh, I don't know."
Alba Libera Marra,00:31:16:19,00:31:20:25,"Must be 2 or 3 months, you know. Then with the broken me."
Unknown Interviewer,00:31:20:27,00:31:21:26,So that was.
Alba Libera Marra,00:31:21:29,00:31:30:02,"And so that after a year, he decided farming was good for him. And he came back here again. And luckily for us."
Unknown Interviewer,00:31:30:04,00:31:30:29,That farm.
Alba Libera Marra,00:31:30:29,00:31:56:20,"Oh, yes, we, we they had paid the majority of it, but then say because of, the crops fail that year, the apples froze the, the everything, the everything went wrong. And so they just didn't make any more payments. They weren't able to make any more payment, and they had just enough to rent a boxcar. You know, in those days, the trains were prevalent."
Alba Libera Marra,00:31:56:27,00:32:08:17,"They rented the boxcar in order to put all the furniture on, and came back and back to the house that they had never sold. They started out from scratch again."
Unknown Interviewer,00:32:08:20,00:32:10:09,So they went away two times.
Alba Libera Marra,00:32:10:09,00:32:11:22,And and came back.
Unknown Interviewer,00:32:11:22,00:32:15:04,"Again. Really, just like mine or mine was."
Alba Libera Marra,00:32:15:07,00:32:34:28,"Where he was. He, was no longer in the mine work when he came back. Then he was in the in the smelter. And he, like, work for a health reasons, you know, a miner can work in the mine just so long. And he had been laid it, you know, prior to the time that he went back and got mother, he had that letter."
Alba Libera Marra,00:32:34:28,00:32:36:19,So he had to be there.
Unknown Interviewer,00:32:38:05,00:32:38:20,Well.
Alba Libera Marra,00:32:38:22,00:33:00:18,"Being married is when the, there's let it hear from in the mine who you get. the, the letter goes into your lungs and then you get a shortness of breath. Your ankles swell. And in those early days, you just had just just rest. Nowadays they have modern medicines that they're able to get."
Unknown Interviewer,00:33:01:21,00:33:06:00,And this happened before you can before he was married.
Alba Libera Marra,00:33:06:03,00:33:30:00,"So they were very long. Oh, it doesn't take long. No. It's dangerous. Okay, so he didn't, you know, couldn't go back in again, which was lucky for him. Yeah. And he was a, flower fancier, like when he was the smelter custodian. He had, you brought, you know, gardenias and all, exotic plants he would send for."
Alba Libera Marra,00:33:30:03,00:33:59:09,"And then he had made, cement out of cement. These, fishbowl the fish tanks. Yeah. And he had trout in there with running water and along with the clams that found on the ports. But I proceeded to room this summer with the remains of one of his night blooming serious. But I've had it at school, and I brought it out, and it wasn't used to the outdoor weather, so I think it's gone."
Unknown Interviewer,00:34:00:21,00:34:04:02,Now that you think that's it. So it couldn't have gotten in the greenhouse.
Alba Libera Marra,00:34:04:05,00:34:26:04,"So that's the area that he had. Lobster Raccoon. He had his own little, greenhouse. and it when I think, you know, you have to go and you pay so much now for a and plant. And he just gave them away by the dozen people came from town, came from everywhere. And he always had a surplus of everything that he gave."
Unknown Interviewer,00:34:26:04,00:34:27:17,Away so that he had.
Alba Libera Marra,00:34:27:17,00:34:31:14,"The green thumb. Now his daughter, but he has the green thumb."
Unknown Interviewer,00:34:31:16,00:34:34:13,"Oh, I can see why you want to try to get into farming."
Alba Libera Marra,00:34:34:14,00:34:37:06,Oh. That's it. Oh.
Unknown Interviewer,00:34:37:09,00:34:51:14,"I know, well, let's talk about maybe your you mentioned some things about your family life and you were tough, financially. Did you feel restricted as a child with your family and to garden when they leave?"
Alba Libera Marra,00:34:51:15,00:34:54:01,"Yeah, yeah. How did the garden out? It goes over."
Unknown Interviewer,00:34:54:01,00:34:54:22,Here. So.
Alba Libera Marra,00:34:54:28,00:35:07:09,"And then we've had we had the financial straits when, when they lost everything, you know, they had put thousands and thousands of dollars into the down payment and then came back with absolutely."
Unknown Interviewer,00:35:07:09,00:35:09:11,Nothing that represent long here and.
Alba Libera Marra,00:35:09:11,00:35:32:13,"Long years of savings. And, you know, the, like, dad would get maybe, you know, in the early days, but it was 2 or $3 a day that you work for. So it took and it took a long time. And then, during the depression, also, there was, we, we had, we had moved from, from Silver King."
Alba Libera Marra,00:35:32:15,00:35:53:05,"We moved, I think was in 1924, and my parents were buying the home, the new home, and they were buying the car, and I was always to go to school. So they mother didn't have a radio they couldn't afford. They felt, you know, they wanted to pay cash for everything. They hated to, other than the house favorite."
Alba Libera Marra,00:35:53:07,00:36:17:24,"And so therefore, she would leave her windows open in the summertime, because the neighbors had a radio so she could, she could get the music. And when I went to school, I worked part time. I got $0.35 an hour working for the the women doing secretarial work. So you some that was, you know, I, I had to pay."
Alba Libera Marra,00:36:17:24,00:36:29:29,"And then, I tried to pay some of it back, you know, and I got out of school. I was always taught, you know, they they were thrifty and tried to save and tried to do what was best."
Unknown Interviewer,00:36:30:02,00:36:32:24,"And your mother did all kinds of things, I'm sure, about canning."
Alba Libera Marra,00:36:32:27,00:36:33:29,"Oh, yes."
Unknown Interviewer,00:36:34:01,00:36:36:19,Supplement. That's right. Yeah. Everybody.
Alba Libera Marra,00:36:36:19,00:36:57:26,"Everybody did. And in the early days out at Silver King, before I was born. See, I was, there were very five years before I ever came along, and she used to wash and iron. There were the the boarding houses, you know, the for the miners that worked up there. And so they would bring their washing down and she was washing."
Alba Libera Marra,00:36:57:26,00:37:17:24,"She never did, keep a boarding house like so many, you know, kept boarders. But she did the washing and the ironing, and she said that she used to iron by, by candlelight and way late in the evening. And all there was, was just the candlelight and maybe there were just 1 or 2 candles, because candles are expensive in those days."
Unknown Interviewer,00:37:17:27,00:37:19:11,And she would have had to keep going.
Alba Libera Marra,00:37:19:14,00:37:38:10,"And, and did the iron on the stove. And that would still work. And then, you know, I can think of the cold nights even as I grew up. It then that same iron was wrapped, you know, in a towel that was heated in the daytime, wrapped in a towel, and went into our bed at night so that we kept warm."
Alba Libera Marra,00:37:39:02,00:37:46:00,"Because, you know where the cold Stone was? There. Yeah. So the old German heater that we have."
Unknown Interviewer,00:37:46:03,00:37:48:17,And get your fabric out and cut wood.

Alba Libera Marra,00:38:03:19,00:38:24:21,"Well, my parents read a lot. Dad was an avid reader and tell stories. I can just remember. They're just some wonderful stories that he told. All these. All the great fairy tales, all the fairy tales I'd heard over and over as a youngster because dad would, would repeat them. Okay."
Unknown Interviewer,00:38:24:24,00:38:27:19,Did you get together with other families?
Alba Libera Marra,00:38:27:19,00:38:31:13,"Oh, yes. There were all the families all around the area there."
Unknown Interviewer,00:38:31:13,00:38:32:00,Picnic?
Alba Libera Marra,00:38:32:00,00:38:32:12,Yes.

Unknown Interviewer,00:38:40:16,00:38:44:09,"Did you, have get togethers with other children?"
Alba Libera Marra,00:38:44:12,00:38:54:20,"Yes. There were the, there were the neighborhood children there for a while. And then the Silver King died down, and then we were the only family there."
Unknown Interviewer,00:38:54:22,00:38:55:15,"Oh, for."
Alba Libera Marra,00:38:55:15,00:39:15:17,"About a block there for a while, our Silver King school got down to so that there were just eight students there, too. So that was. Yes, there were eight. Like, say, in one room and maybe eight in the other room. So, it, it went down and then went back up again."
Unknown Interviewer,00:39:15:19,00:39:17:13,But the families would get together.
Alba Libera Marra,00:39:17:13,00:39:18:14,Would get together.
Unknown Interviewer,00:39:18:14,00:39:24:29,"And how do you put it a contrast. You see, with children nowadays, that's the thing they do for fun for family."
Alba Libera Marra,00:39:24:29,00:39:46:20,"Or they need they need so many more toys. They need to be entertained. They have to have their radio room, their TV. But we were we could make up things and, you know, work and do things. And, I didn't have a piano. And I can remember we had, an old writing desk, you know, that came down, you know, like piano."
Alba Libera Marra,00:39:46:27,00:40:12:04,"And I would put and use it there and pretend like I was playing the piano and sing, and I can't carry a tune. I don't know what more, but they were soft. But, I mean, we just we were able to, to do the thing. We hypnotized each other.

Alba Libera Marra,00:40:34:23,00:40:57:07,"Go to the bat, May, and then go back home again. Some of the time we walked part of the way, some of the time we were, we'd take the train and we'd have to walk from. Silver came down to Bradley, which is about a mile or a mile and a half, and then we'd get the train from Bradley, come into Kellogg, and then go to our show and able to catch the train back."
Alba Libera Marra,00:40:57:10,00:41:15:20,"Go back again. Okay. That's all. The Chautauqua is the early time Chautauqua was. We always came in whenever they had the Chautauqua would come to town. And, you know, the day up in the in, 10 to 10 and we'd get to come in and watch and watch that."
Unknown Interviewer,00:41:15:23,00:41:20:24,I was wondering what the kind of things you had in Chicago top the lecture. Well.

Alba Libera Marra,00:42:17:28,00:42:44:06,"They would be big, touring cars and we'd get a chance to come in or then the rest of the time, or sometime when there would be mail delivery. across with your livery and when the grocery delivery truck came in, then we'd get a chance to ride, into town with them, too. But every Saturday, I think we we never missed a Saturday."
Alba Libera Marra,00:42:44:09,00:43:05:27,"And we we didn't think anything of Rocky. It was just fun. And the neighborhood I could remember, the Yankees lived there, and we would walk in with the Yankees and and, we had other friends that that, lived here in town that came out to work out to see us and just stay out there and and summer."
Alba Libera Marra,00:43:05:28,00:43:32:28,"And you just didn't. You didn't pay any attention. You weren't afraid of anything. Our winters were bad, though. The winters sometimes. Our, snow was 5 or 6ft high. It the drift saw em. They would be just as high as the as the woodshed. that it, and all the shoveling. We don't have snow. We complain about our winters now, but they're nothing like they used to be."

Alba Libera Marra,00:44:03:24,00:44:10:25,"Inexperienced, so it must have been because the wages were so small them that they did have to be."
Unknown Interviewer,00:44:10:28,00:44:13:01,But when that show would come to town.

We had to go clear to Wallace that they had a car, and so they came and got me, and I went. I don't remember if my mother went with me or I went alone with them, but, you know, we didn't grow up there. The children have, many more opportunities than we have, but they grow up too fast."
Alba Libera Marra,00:44:54:29,00:44:59:18,"They just, they're living their lives much faster than we ever did."

That that kind, that some people think that, that people got more among the women, became more dependent and not as capable in some maybe in urban areas. you recognized that it can happen where you consider."
Unknown Interviewer,00:46:36:15,00:46:42:08,"It like it was coming through, that the women were pitched in and we were in the older days."
Alba Libera Marra,00:46:42:14,00:47:12:26,"In the older days, they they had their own type. type of work there. In the old days, the women didn't go out and work. They the woman's work was mainly in the in the home or helping the neighbors. Now, that's one thing we didn't mention, like in Prosser. Yeah. A mother not only, had to had to do her own irrigating and do her milking and take care of the chickens and take it, you know, do the farm work."
Alba Libera Marra,00:47:12:28,00:47:25:08,"But then when the, when it was haying time, then you went across the street and you helped the people across the street, hey, are you and a half a mile down and you help the others."
Unknown Interviewer,00:47:25:28,00:47:26:18,hay.

And then, every, every Sunday you got into the horse and buggy and either neighbors came in from all around the area that, there were a group of of Italian. There was the Goodyear on those on the border, you know, them, the Yankees."
Alba Libera Marra,00:47:53:14,00:48:23:05,"And there were a group, but they didn't. And the parties, the parties live in car, and one of them live in Spokane now. But, and I hear from all these different people, but we just, we would go to, to run farm or the other and all the others would come in and everybody would bring food, and you just have, you know, a general picnic and just to share their, share their, their, ideas of what they had done."
Alba Libera Marra,00:48:23:11,00:48:40:13,"But of course, there was always the time that you had to plan to get home early enough in order to feed the animals, because the everything else on Sunday, everything else could, go by the wayside. But, you know, your animals had to have the food."
Unknown Interviewer,00:48:40:15,00:48:49:21,"Yeah. Or that this was, Italian got together with other ethnic groups. Were you aware of that? Yeah."

Unknown Interviewer,00:49:00:07,00:49:01:24,"So it wasn't,"
Alba Libera Marra,00:49:01:26,00:49:06:06,"No, no, no, no. You ever lived around there?"
Unknown Interviewer,00:49:06:19,00:49:10:05,"and the other area had had, had."

Unknown Interviewer,00:49:12:22,00:49:14:28,And that's kind of changed. Yeah.
Alba Libera Marra,00:49:15:00,00:49:37:28,"I, I just don't know what they do out in the, in the farm areas now. They're just moved now. Like I haven't been back to Prosser for years because all the people have gradually they're just one family. They're left that I know and the others are just they've died. You know, as you get older, the, more and more of your friends disappear and you have to make new friends."
Unknown Interviewer,00:49:38:03,00:49:44:11,"Yeah, but in town, it seems as though people stay together in their new career. Family."
Alba Libera Marra,00:49:44:12,00:49:51:05,"Family, yes, more. But you move more in towns to your area, you know, changes."
Unknown Interviewer,00:49:51:07,00:49:52:12,So you don't build up.
Alba Libera Marra,00:49:52:19,00:49:57:21,"Your own build up the the friendship, long, long term friendships as much."
Unknown Interviewer,00:49:58:13,00:49:59:20,So that someone. Okay.
Alba Libera Marra,00:49:59:22,00:50:17:20,"That's right. And the women in in towns or in, in areas like here have an opportunity to go to work, let's say for the smelter or there are opportunities, more office work or more, types of work that they can, they can do."
Unknown Interviewer,00:50:17:23,00:50:27:17,"And it seems, though, when they have more money, well, they could talk last night about how people come in and help in times of disaster. That's right, that's right. That's that's still."
Alba Libera Marra,00:50:27:19,00:50:30:05,That's still up the other happens over.
Unknown Interviewer,00:50:30:08,00:50:39:19,At some other areas. I think that they there's some realization that people have more money and they can go by whatever happens back to you. In the old days.
Alba Libera Marra,00:50:39:22,00:50:40:17,You had demand.
Unknown Interviewer,00:50:40:17,00:50:41:25,And left on the money.

Unknown Interviewer,00:50:45:11,00:51:02:10,"Yeah. So, did the next question was, and of course, you've kind of answered it, I guess. Did your mother ever worry about what would happen if something happened to your father? Oh, yes. It,"
Alba Libera Marra,00:51:02:13,00:51:24:22,"Yes, that that was hard. And how are you living? No, no, no, like I can remember when we were. It's over. King dad had pleurisy so bad and the doctor came down and didn't think that, you know, he would live. Oh, it it was hard there for days. Now you have your Social Security. The the money goes in for social Security."
Alba Libera Marra,00:51:24:22,00:51:55:06,"And something happens to the breadwinner. The widow and the children are taken care of. And then there was absolutely there was nothing to, nothing to take care of you. And so therefore, you had to save. You tried to save. So for an emergency. And that's what worried mother. So was when they lost. Absolutely everything where they went to prosper and then so they had to start trying to build up to save because you had to, for your insurances."
Alba Libera Marra,00:51:55:06,00:52:25:20,"You had to, there wasn't the health insurance is there weren't the health insurances that there are now for the families. Yeah. Yeah. If the companies had insurances. Yeah. The only one that was carried was the, the person that was working. And if they were injured, then they were taken care of. But the rest of the family there was, there were weren't any hospitalization, any doctor, anything that took care of them."
Unknown Interviewer,00:52:25:22,00:52:28:06,There must have been some women who were left widowed over.

Unknown Interviewer,00:52:29:13,00:52:32:04,That's correct. What what kind of work would they go into?
Alba Libera Marra,00:52:32:05,00:52:57:18,"The, so many of them are, Well, now we have there's the one of our good friends. Her husband was killed in the mine disaster. And so then she started taking in boarders, boarders and rumors. That's, Now I can think of two. I can think of three different families that, they that's what they did. And cook seized by taking in the borders."
Alba Libera Marra,00:52:57:18,00:53:02:27,"And that was then. That was the one, steady income that they had."
Unknown Interviewer,00:53:02:29,00:53:05:03,So there were a lot of single men.

Unknown Interviewer,00:53:09:07,00:53:16:05,"do you think there was a certain pressure to get married again, if you could possibly do it?"
Alba Libera Marra,00:53:16:08,00:53:22:07,"I just I suppose so if somebody said yes, we'll make them see that they have to. Yes."
Unknown Interviewer,00:53:22:09,00:53:23:11,Especially if you had young.

Unknown Interviewer,00:54:18:02,00:54:20:19,"After, no. In some other. But, no."

Alba Libera Marra,00:54:32:01,00:54:57:06,"No. yeah. I think I, I realized I had, well, I like, I had a Carol came down when I was a little girl. She was a schoolteacher. She was, maiden schoolteacher. And I just idolized her. I idolized miss, Dustin when I was at Lewiston. Who is the dean of women, and she was a miss."
Alba Libera Marra,00:54:57:12,00:55:17:24,"I think now, as I, you know, go back and look at it. I, that was my idea that, I'd. I wanted to be a teacher. I wanted to have contact with children. That was my satisfaction that I. That I was able to help others. But still, I wanted to have my freedom and do as I please."
Alba Libera Marra,00:55:17:24,00:55:26:09,"And I figured that as long as I was single, that I could go and come and there wasn't anybody to boss me."
Unknown Interviewer,00:55:26:12,00:55:27:02,You must.
Alba Libera Marra,00:55:27:04,00:55:30:13,"Slip. I was an early bird, you know that."

Unknown Interviewer,00:56:00:23,00:56:02:20,You.
Alba Libera Marra,00:56:02:23,00:56:12:06,"That's what somebody said to me you early last fall said, well, you're single because you want to not not because you didn't have chances."
Unknown Interviewer,00:56:12:09,00:56:18:26,"So even that now, that's right. With your work, you anticipate other things."
Alba Libera Marra,00:56:18:28,00:56:52:20,"Yeah. Just I just I up to this time, I've always never had to worry about, what I was going to do. There's only one thing, the married people have more chances. As we were talking in the discussion, you know, with that young girl that didn't have work, it's true with all of us that married people have more of an opportunity to go out more and to, to have maybe a better way and a better time, maybe in their own way of, of doing things."
Alba Libera Marra,00:56:52:20,00:57:08:05,"Well, I say they, they go to, Beer halls, hotel. I went to nightclubs. You know, they have there's always somebody there to take that. Whereas the, the single person is, restricted in their activities."
Alba Libera Marra,00:57:09:00,00:57:13:23,"Well, I, I specially when I, and I don't drink and I don't smoke, so it's,"
Unknown Interviewer,00:57:13:25,00:57:17:06,And our social customs are kind of geared to couples together.
Alba Libera Marra,00:57:17:13,00:57:18:27,They're a couple. That's right.
Unknown Interviewer,00:57:19:23,00:57:23:11,So your your get more or less has to be other single.

Unknown Interviewer,00:57:30:22,00:57:34:08,"For, for women who have become widows at. It's a religious."
Alba Libera Marra,00:57:34:10,00:57:37:00,That's right. It makes a quite an adjustment.
Unknown Interviewer,00:57:37:02,00:57:41:06,Because they can't go on. same relationship. I.
Alba Libera Marra,00:57:41:12,00:57:57:29,"Know that, too, you know, so they, And I noticed that in my cousin, you know, she notices it now, too, as, as a widow. It's different when she had her husband in, you know, places to go to, and you don't you don't go some places just as a person alone."
Unknown Interviewer,00:57:59:07,00:58:00:10,so that's just part of.
Alba Libera Marra,00:58:00:15,00:58:22:06,"That bad part that you ever. But I just I just take off, I mean, and make my own entertainment and keep busy as long as I'm able to drive the car and can feel independent, it. I take others that don't have cars. I try to take them out as much as possible."
Unknown Interviewer,00:58:22:08,00:58:39:20,"You mentioned briefly the depression, the effects of the depression on the area. and we haven't talked about the war years with, with the, the war time, you took her to war under certain horrors."
Alba Libera Marra,00:58:39:20,00:59:17:08,"Or if you remember. I'm sorry I didn't. Yes. And, that was that when we were in Prussia. So that was in about 19. 80? No, I started school in 1980. So that was between 18 and 21. Okay. So that, in the war years and then in the, in the Second World War, I was going to go away into the service, but, I, my duty was, was, teaching because there was such a scarcity of teaching teachers that, it was just as important."
Alba Libera Marra,00:59:17:08,00:59:27:08,"They persuaded me that it was just as important to stay as as a teacher, as it was to volunteer my services in another area."
Unknown Interviewer,00:59:27:10,00:59:28:19,Must have been a temptation.
Alba Libera Marra,00:59:28:19,00:59:58:07,"Okay. Yes, yes, that's just it. And now I regret it. That's the one regret that I do have in my life, is that I didn't leave and go into the service, and then I would have, had more opportunities, maybe for further education, whereas all my education, I paid every bit of it on my own. Whereas now do you would they, the GI Bill with the GI Bill, they were able to, you know, get, more of that."
Alba Libera Marra,00:59:58:07,01:00:17:26,"The one regret, I guess, that I if I have any regrets of what I, what I do differently, that's what I would have done. I would have seen the world instead of having to go out and and see the world now on my own, I think I would have I would have, profited maybe. And that in a way, maybe I would have profited."
Alba Libera Marra,01:00:17:26,01:00:23:15,"Maybe, who's to know? How can we can't look back? we have to look ahead. I think."
Unknown Interviewer,01:00:24:10,01:00:34:15,"but that was a time when your parents were pretty well taken care of them. That's right. Freedom. That's right. have gotten away with that, too. There are many things that you."
Unknown Interviewer,01:00:37:10,01:00:49:23,"how did, Which do you think had more affect on this community or similar? Excuse the depression or the war? Was a different were there any comparisons there?"
Alba Libera Marra,01:00:49:25,01:01:13:22,"I see that during the depression, I that was, my latter high school years and then that and then I went the two years that I think the depression was really the at its worst that, I was going to school at Lewiston. So I just, and, you know, you're cloistered, maybe one. But you're in school, you live in a dorm, you're locked in at 8:00."
Alba Libera Marra,01:01:13:22,01:01:32:29,"That's the difference between now. We were locked in every night at 8:00. We were locked in. Can remember our room got up to 117 at, at the dorm, but we weren't allowed out after 8:00 at night. That was, after all, that red bell,"
Unknown Interviewer,01:01:33:02,01:01:34:19,So the weren't restricted?
Alba Libera Marra,01:01:34:24,01:01:38:08,"No, although the men were very strict, but we were all,"
Unknown Interviewer,01:01:38:11,01:01:40:16,Cloistered with that every night.
Alba Libera Marra,01:01:40:18,01:01:48:24,"Every night except, you were allowed to stay out until either 10 or 11:00 on, Friday and Saturday night."
Unknown Interviewer,01:01:49:01,01:01:50:07,You probably a psycho.
Alba Libera Marra,01:01:50:09,01:02:00:11,"Yeah. You had. Oh, you had to sign out where you were going and you had to sign in when you when you came in and who you were going with after school."
Unknown Interviewer,01:02:00:13,01:02:02:29,And did you ever come over one week here?
Alba Libera Marra,01:02:03:02,01:02:27:02,"No. The only time I came home was at, Christmas time. And see, we went, we went to Lewiston by, by train. There weren't busses when, when I went to school there. So we would we went, took a train. We had train service out of, out of here and went into Lewiston. And in a way, we were better off."
Alba Libera Marra,01:02:27:02,01:02:59:29,"Then we had more bus, more busses that took us into Spokane or we had the trains. In the earlier days, we had trained, I think it was twice a day. And you had better services than you have now. Now you have very, very poor, busses and very poor bus connections. You get very, very limited. And it's getting and it's getting worse and worse because people have cars now and they're not supporting the public transportation."
Unknown Interviewer,01:03:00:03,01:03:02:09,That they have. And they have to choose to.
Alba Libera Marra,01:03:02:11,01:03:05:12,Do something where they have to be that.
Unknown Interviewer,01:03:05:15,01:03:07:10,I think it's interesting because.
Alba Libera Marra,01:03:07:10,01:03:32:17,"Like, now I leave, when I leave for Europe, the bus leaves at 750 in the morning. Well, I'll either and I don't want to drive my car and leave my car down there for six weeks in Spokane, so most likely I'll have to go in. Unless somebody takes me in. I'll have to go in and spend another night in Spokane at the hotel, rather than making the connections."
Unknown Interviewer,01:03:32:27,01:03:40:27,"when you were growing up, do you have impression of your parents making decisions together, or were there things your your father could make decisions?"
Alba Libera Marra,01:03:41:04,01:03:44:12,"Yeah, I think they worked on quite a bit together."
Alba Libera Marra,01:03:45:13,01:03:49:02,"But clearly there were some things that, that,"
Unknown Interviewer,01:03:52:06,01:04:11:20,"we, I went into one which gave me a chance to look over some of the questions. That's good. I appreciate that. what, as a result of living through the depression, compare yourself with your attitudes toward money and work with some younger people who didn't think through their differences."
Alba Libera Marra,01:04:11:23,01:04:35:22,"I think it, it built in me a sense of frugality that I've, I walk, I watch what I spend, and I, I still have a tendency to think twice before, before I get something that, some sometimes I'm fine. So."
Alba Libera Marra,01:04:35:25,01:04:50:26,"I'm. I'm fine. Sometimes I go overboard. But, I mean, your, when when you're, frugal, you, you don't lose that that sense of balance. You don't lose that value."
Unknown Interviewer,01:04:50:28,01:04:53:23,And you get credit back. Credit. Yeah.
Alba Libera Marra,01:04:53:25,01:05:27:16,"I do buy on credit. I do it because they say that that you should establish, it should establish credit, that if you pay cash for everything, then you are just lost. So I have a Bank America card, and I have credit at, at the crest of an appendage because then by, and using that every so often and paying regularly, then you have that as a reference, because I'm very surprised now that when you go to cash a check, they say, well, now what?"
Alba Libera Marra,01:05:27:26,01:05:40:04,"like the other day they said and it was, it was in Cart Lane, a present, your present, your driver's license and two credit cards before you cash the check. so we have been."
Unknown Interviewer,01:05:40:05,01:05:41:05,A lot of abuses.
Alba Libera Marra,01:05:41:05,01:06:02:28,"I know it behooves a person to, know that you want it. Yes, I and I watch it very, very carefully and not, not for a large amount. And I try to get it paid off, you know, within the next month. That's why right now I'm having a little bit of difficulty, because going to Europe, I don't want to have any, any debts outstanding."
Alba Libera Marra,01:06:02:28,01:06:07:05,So I'm trying to get everything taken care of.
Unknown Interviewer,01:06:07:08,01:06:17:11,"And I'm sure you mentioned the fact that your parents, bought only their home, a large purchase. credit, payment."
Alba Libera Marra,01:06:17:13,01:06:19:22,"And then the car, the the car."
Unknown Interviewer,01:06:19:22,01:06:20:17,They call that was a.
Alba Libera Marra,01:06:20:17,01:06:30:17,"Strong. Yeah. That's right. And that was hard to be paying for a home and to be paying for a car when the wages were, is, as low as they were."
Unknown Interviewer,01:06:30:18,01:06:32:15,And then saving up this.
Alba Libera Marra,01:06:32:17,01:06:41:19,"And trying to save up a reserve and trying to help me to just send me to school, that took. Really? Yeah. That's a thing in my budget in order to do it."
Unknown Interviewer,01:06:41:25,01:06:43:23,Your mother did all right. No.
Alba Libera Marra,01:06:43:25,01:07:11:24,"I mean, mother, it had, to have serious surgery, you know, during during that my high school days and that had taken, and of course, they had that the dad insisted that had to be paid for in cash. So they had, or stand, you know, and so all that was all cashed in and everything was cashed and all the reserve that they'd had was cashed in for the, for the operation."
Alba Libera Marra,01:07:11:26,01:07:18:18,Whereas now you pay into insurance and then the insurance helps you out. Okay.
Unknown Interviewer,01:07:18:27,01:07:23:11,how do you feel about work if helping children mature? Did you have duties at home?
Alba Libera Marra,01:07:23:13,01:07:35:17,"Oh, yes, I had the regular, yeah, the chores, the dishes and, dusty. Them not got anything too strenuous that would hurt me. But there was the regular duties that had to be done."
Unknown Interviewer,01:07:35:19,01:07:38:29,And the kids just went outside work later that.
Alba Libera Marra,01:07:39:06,01:07:41:18,I did very little of that with.
Unknown Interviewer,01:07:41:21,01:07:42:16,Their.
Alba Libera Marra,01:07:42:19,01:08:07:20,"I did, but you know what? We could, what was available there? or going back, you know, you talked about recreation. There was the Playhouse. My dad had built me, out of the old dynamite, boxes. And he had gotten land, lumber, and then out of the dynamite boxes he'd built, this huge playhouse was just like."
Alba Libera Marra,01:08:07:21,01:08:24:17,"It was just like a regular room. And my friends always, you know, could come in when I was at So King, we had fun there, played. Okay. That's it. You know, you did. You did. You made things with your parents, took care of you."
Unknown Interviewer,01:08:24:19,01:08:32:10,"Well, another change that we have mentioned only in passing, the fact that there was a time when people seemed to have more children than they really."
Alba Libera Marra,01:08:32:11,01:08:33:07,"Oh, yes. That to."
Unknown Interviewer,01:08:33:07,01:08:35:25,"You and I'm sure as a teacher, you've observed how."
Alba Libera Marra,01:08:35:26,01:08:36:08,You.
Unknown Interviewer,01:08:36:10,01:08:37:23,Might have been better off if they had.
Alba Libera Marra,01:08:37:24,01:08:38:27,If they had.
Unknown Interviewer,01:08:38:29,01:08:44:12,"Have you allowed that, the option now women have for limiting their family?"
Alba Libera Marra,01:08:44:15,01:08:50:23,"Oh, I think it's wonderful for them to, to have that opportunity. Except except a response."
Unknown Interviewer,01:08:50:24,01:09:07:20,"That's right. In that area. Well, I've asked you quite a few question, and I've gotten an awful lot of interesting information. Is there anything else you'd like to add or discuss a maybe about as you plan your future? Now, you retired a little early."
Alba Libera Marra,01:09:07:21,01:09:10:16,"Yes, I retired. I took a retirement two years early."
Unknown Interviewer,01:09:11:02,01:09:12:06,because you admitted.
Alba Libera Marra,01:09:12:08,01:09:37:10,"Yeah. I enjoy is what I enjoy. It. And then, as I mentioned offhand, that this friend who had cancer last year, she was teaching school, and in June, she, developed cancer, went in for surgery, came home for a week. We put her in the hospital the 16th of July, and she stayed there until Palm Sunday. And and I just decided that she was good."
Alba Libera Marra,01:09:37:10,01:10:02:21,"She was to just retire this August and she would have been 65. But I decided that if I was going to do the things and relax, that I might just as well retire early. And while I still had my health, because you never know from day to day, you don't know what's going to come up next. So you just try to do your best and and being alone."
Alba Libera Marra,01:10:02:24,01:10:15:05,"As to it's it's unusual being an only child, not having brothers or sisters, not having not having married. It's just, a unique situation that not very many are in."
Unknown Interviewer,01:10:15:07,01:10:17:17,That this is your first time to go to Europe.
Alba Libera Marra,01:10:17:18,01:10:36:13,"Yes. That's right, I had I was going to go there and then the war broke out before and I was unable to go. And now my cousin, the one cousin that I'm going to be visiting mainly is 79 years old. And you know, when she's getting older that I might just as well do it now."
Unknown Interviewer,01:10:36:16,01:10:38:01,I shouldn't be safe and out.
Alba Libera Marra,01:10:38:01,01:10:51:26,"So I'll visit, I'll visit her for the three weeks, and then from there I'll leave there and, go to London and then make my other tour on this TWA getaway tour."
Unknown Interviewer,01:10:51:29,01:10:54:11,Which corresponded over the years.
Alba Libera Marra,01:10:54:13,01:11:01:23,"Oh, yes. and more. More so since mother's passed away, I think more than any other time."
Unknown Interviewer,01:11:01:26,01:11:03:04,You took over your mother.
Alba Libera Marra,01:11:03:04,01:11:14:13,"Did it? Yeah, my mother did before. It's funny. See, mother had, mother as mother or grandmother had raised for me. And so the mother and Billy grew up together."
Unknown Interviewer,01:11:14:16,01:11:16:08,Did she ever have a chance to go back?
Alba Libera Marra,01:11:16:14,01:11:21:25,"No. She wanted to see. That's what I said. She didn't get to,"
Unknown Interviewer,01:11:21:27,01:11:23:27,Do you correspond in Italian?
Alba Libera Marra,01:11:23:29,01:11:54:15,"Oh, yes. I have to do there. Except for this Cornelia. The, the the bunny step granddaughter. And she was a French teacher in Italy. And so then. And, so when she was married, she continued teaching. But when her husband was transferred to United States for the Olivetti company, then she came here and she called me one Sunday morning, I got a telephone call, but I didn't even know there was a Cornelia."
Alba Libera Marra,01:11:54:17,01:12:13:16,"And she said, I'm your cousin. And so from then on, we correspond. But she writes in English and I, I write to her and I write to her in English. But, Tiffany, I have to write in Italian, and I had to keep up on my Italian. I've had to look up words that I don't know how to spell."
Alba Libera Marra,01:12:13:16,01:12:34:04,"And maybe it's been good for me. But I don't know how I. I'm going to get along three weeks and speaking nothing but Italian. And because now when I if I can't or what I was speaking to my mother, if I couldn't think of the Italian word, I could always swing back into the English manufacturer word."
Alba Libera Marra,01:12:34:06,01:12:41:22,"And what am I going to do? Now that I have a few qualms? I'll tell you what I come back. Oh, I got along well."
Unknown Interviewer,01:12:41:22,01:12:44:10,I think you you may you grow tired.
Alba Libera Marra,01:12:44:24,01:13:00:18,"I guess I'm afraid. Yeah. Because now, you know, I go out with people, and then I think it'll be so nice to get home if I have peace and quiet. But I would have be peace and quiet. I'm just wondering. So I do have some qualms."
Unknown Interviewer,01:13:00:20,01:13:05:02,"That it is a strange. That's right. In another line, I don't hear how."
Alba Libera Marra,01:13:05:05,01:13:06:23,To be able to speak and not.
Unknown Interviewer,01:13:06:23,01:13:11:16,"Be immersed in it, but it. And at three weeks I was right."
Alba Libera Marra,01:13:11:18,01:13:20:11,"And then I'm worried. And when I get to the other countries, although there will be the guide and that will help where,"
Unknown Interviewer,01:13:20:13,01:13:23:21,I think you're going to have some doors open to do.
Alba Libera Marra,01:13:23:24,01:13:26:19,That to the others side. I was with her.
Unknown Interviewer,01:13:26:21,01:13:30:20,"At the area. Oh, now, because there are children now."
Alba Libera Marra,01:13:30:20,01:13:57:26,"That's just it. So. And another retired teacher will join me in, London. She's, She's not leaving the first. She will leave about the 15th and go to Oslo, and then she'll fly in on the, 22nd of September, and we'll get in the day before the tour starts, because the people fly in from the United States on the 22nd, but don't get in until the 23rd."
Alba Libera Marra,01:13:57:28,01:14:22:19,"And so we're going to take it an extra night there in London, so that we'll be there and hope that we'll get in on the tours and not miss out. So it's just in a way, it's too bad that I'm not going from the United States with the tour and coming back, but I've wanted to. This is the chance of a lifetime, and I wanted to visit the relatives as well."
Alba Libera Marra,01:14:22:20,01:14:35:08,"Yeah. Otherwise I could have taken this wrong bear tour. That would get really wonderful. That's, you know, made up of mainly Inland Empire people. This. Now we all have any idea who will be on the tour."
Unknown Interviewer,01:14:35:10,01:14:37:04,And you'll have an opportunity up for new.
Alba Libera Marra,01:14:37:10,01:14:39:03,To for new experiences. I can see.
Unknown Interviewer,01:14:39:03,01:14:46:22,"Sometimes when you go with hometown people, I haven't visited them. You're going in in Italy or someplace talking about hometown."
Alba Libera Marra,01:14:46:22,01:14:48:15,I know what that's just here.
Unknown Interviewer,01:14:48:15,01:14:49:25,"And, so you'll be."
Alba Libera Marra,01:14:49:27,01:15:12:02,"Oh, so this will be interesting. At first they had me book going into Amsterdam and then from Amsterdam down to Milan, but now they have me so that I go directly from New York to Milan. So I think that may be better. I didn't like the idea of landing in Amsterdam and not knowing the language at all at the beginning."
Alba Libera Marra,01:15:12:29,01:15:21:27,"I better get used to it. And the many, many changes I'm has me a little bit perturbed now, too. Yeah."
Unknown Interviewer,01:15:23:01,01:15:24:15,"Well, it's gonna be an exciting."
Alba Libera Marra,01:15:24:16,01:15:36:08,"It'll be something different, as I say. You know, I say that I haven't retired, I've just graduated into something different. Right? This is, this is another graduation."
Unknown Interviewer,01:15:36:08,01:15:41:14,"And I imagine if you come back, gonna. Here of numerous occasions when you get your talents."
Alba Libera Marra,01:15:41:18,01:15:57:19,"And you get well and then it well and then and, vocation took care of cleaning the house and weeding all these years of collect should care so much to do that. I know that I. I won't be lonesome for the first year or two now. So then we'll see."
Unknown Interviewer,01:15:57:21,01:16:00:24,"Well, to, that,"
