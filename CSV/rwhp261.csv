Unknown Interviewer,00;22;55;26,00;22;57;03,"No, I was not."
Bonnie Nellsch,00;22;57;05,00;23;06;21,"The lawyers up here aren't going to tell you that you can write up your own little divorce for about $75, isn't it? in California? Is it less than that? Well."

Bonnie Nellsch,00;23;13;00,00;23;16;14,Convinced that the only way you can do it is if you go through them?
Unknown Interviewer,00;23;16;16,00;23;23;15,"Yeah. I wanted to write you for a divorce, and I paid for myself because I definitely want,"
Bonnie Nellsch,00;23;23;18,00;23;36;10,"Some woman in California is really pushing it, and she's off for the the women of a day know I. I've never heard of it. I just saw it on TV the other day. I thought it was great. You know, the people on your door."
Unknown Interviewer,00;23;36;13,00;23;37;19,Yeah. You're not ready.

Unknown Interviewer,00;23;51;05,00;24;15;15,"For instance. Oh, I hate to bring this up into the conversation. Okay. You, for instance, I know of a person that she didn't know what you are, and she didn't know what she looked like. Married to the air. She wanted you here to get out. Really? What she wanted for. She decided she wanted a divorce, but she wasn't for sure."
Unknown Interviewer,00;24;15;15,00;24;37;09,"Right. You know, well, in a case like this. Because I don't know anything about right now. You know what? I don't understand what you're really talking about. But in a case like this, if she went ahead and wrote up Brown divorce, well, then they would. This couple with the divorce not long after work, two months to two months, she ran around without her kids move out of their home."
Unknown Interviewer,00;24;37;09,00;25;04;20,"I want to decide who I am now or who how they were still married. The husband told them that you know, or took her back. I should say. Well, but I mean, you know, I just want to make a quick decision right into it. Yeah, yeah, well, you can get everything right and then get married, right? But, I think what you do is you just write up all the legal things."
Bonnie Nellsch,00;25;04;22,00;25;10;12,"All right? It's difficult that you put up between a circuit, before circuit judge or something."
Unknown Interviewer,00;25;10;15,00;25;34;18,"And then you have to wait for the 22 days or whatever. Right. It's all right. I just I just feel like, if you really want a divorce, right? I definitely wanted a divorce. It would have been great. But for somebody that that is. Well, I think I do. I think I want to work around. No, I don't want to."

She was interested in this guy that I do now. And, I just got out of the Navy, and, I didn't have anything much to do, and so I found a job, and so I, she suggested that I start writing to him because she wasn't going to write to him anymore."
Bonnie Nellsch,00;30;06;01,00;30;12;03,So I started writing to him. And he was in Vietnam at the time.

And so he put on his clothes and ran outside, and it had been raining where you see where the guy had been."

But then, something else happened and they never showed up at all. And so I oftentimes I spoke right around the house or something. I don't know, sometimes they're right there in front of them. I don't know."
Unknown Interviewer,00;33;13;27,00;33;22;26,I think I got them because they're in somebody's.

Unknown Interviewer,01;09;47;17,01;10;10;00,"But now we can make breakfast with pies, and you don't go after you get the ball. You can play with that. Go back to the pie for hours and kind of pick up on that. It really keeps losing weight. Consider that. Don't keep people more disease and then some expensive course you've got."

Unknown Interviewer,01;11;28;21,01;11;41;16,"Yeah, yeah. I guess this is a kind of a bad question. That's informative. Have you ever thought about what you would do if something were to happen to your husband?"
Bonnie Nellsch,01;11;41;19,01;11;58;26,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Only for I work from a financial standpoint, what I would do to carry on afterwards. But other than that, I mean, we just sat down and discussed what we would do and what my. Oh yeah, and what he would want me to do and what I would want."
Unknown Interviewer,01;11;59;00,01;12;02;13,Do you mind going into that?
Bonnie Nellsch,01;12;02;16,01;12;32;14,"Oh, I don't mind. now with, for instance, if he were to die, we would, we would discuss how much the insurance would cover on, any bills that we might have and how much the insurance. I would get money. And, I would, pay the house up a couple years in. Most things we have have an insurance on that would pay him off if I had any debts at the time, and then I would go ahead and wait till the girls were both in school."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;12;32;14,01;12;49;17,"And then I would go to a nursing school and, get married. And that's what I would do now if I were to die. I told him you would. Naturally, you would have that big of a problem as much as a wife would, I don't think, because he would still have his job and he would just carry on."
Unknown Interviewer,01;12;49;20,01;12;52;01,And probably to find he would be careful.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;12;52;04,01;12;55;17,"Right. That would be his main problem. Whereas me, I'd be a little harder."
Unknown Interviewer,01;12;55;21,01;13;27;26,"Yeah. I guess your problem would be, if I was to die. There won't be during that here. Yeah. So there's never a way out. So we have kind of a situation where the worst happens. You guys, I just, I roll over my grave very regret. The girl, the car would really be bad if they were separated, so I don't know how things would turn out."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;13;27;26,01;13;30;07,Their their wives legally could get.
Unknown Interviewer,01;13;30;14,01;13;43;13,"Yeah, you could legally have her. Although you never had a great year. Oh, no. well, I don't know how many you ever had or something like that, but that would be your own problem with trying to carry."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;13;43;16,01;13;45;01,So what? What do I have to.
Unknown Interviewer,01;13;45;01,01;13;49;28,Do if I'm happy to be out?
Unknown Interviewer,01;13;50;01,01;14;00;22,"Man. And I, I'm not a person to live by myself. I like the people I married."
Unknown Interviewer,01;14;00;25,01;14;08;11,"Well, I need you to support you. I like to have a man there to lean on. If something comes up, I. Well, I."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;14;08;11,01;14;16;17,"Have to, but my first thought wouldn't be the man. My first thought would be to handle my own life. I would have to grab whoever came."
Unknown Interviewer,01;14;16;19,01;14;40;05,"I would grab just over the came along. I would have to be, first man. That would be right for the kids and for you and for me. But I would never. What would I want you to do if that were correct? For 2 or 3 years? Oh, I mean time. What would I do? I really have no, I have no idea what for sure I would do."
Unknown Interviewer,01;14;40;05,01;14;48;22,"I retired from some, after the kids are in school over with my school. I tried to find something for this."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;14;48;24,01;14;51;16,"Well, you could live on Social Security and."
Unknown Interviewer,01;14;51;19,01;14;58;24,"I don't know, like it or not, you know, if you have kids, social security for tracing for myself. But I really could carry it."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;14;58;24,01;15;01;17,You just have to trust me.
Unknown Interviewer,01;15;01;19,01;15;32;12,"This friend of the situation right here, this area is not at all interesting. It's really sad because I work for him. If you have one from senior, but he was not very nice. last time he was here was in January and he was in there volunteers to do two characters in Iraq he was more worried about,"
Unknown Interviewer,01;15;32;14,01;16;01;06,"Bringing her arm in her back, which I was really, hurt over that because you would have thought, you know, he definitely ran worth more than he did. That means he was actually really impressed with your senior. But, I guess he was more interested in your father, who? So I'm hoping eventually that you will find out your doctor visits and central figure."
Unknown Interviewer,01;16;01;09,01;16;22;25,"Yeah. And every month, I think he was wearing the service. So we're going out about five months. He's been out. I haven't come out for five months. Going forward. You just automatically took it out. Check. Checking out my wife sometimes is concerned that, like."
Unknown Interviewer,01;16;23;04,01;16;47;22,"the directions the the child support I kind of ways that that kind of these. Yeah. Yeah that to you I, I think if I remember right there was it has to be over a certain amount and you doesn't pay over this amount to be able to have the right to clean up at that. He was trying to tell me he's happy, right?"
Unknown Interviewer,01;16;47;22,01;17;06;17,"I don't want to do it. He wouldn't want who I knew. So I'm not going to say could claim ma'am, I refuse to. And have to back. Up."
Unknown Interviewer,01;17;06;20,01;17;14;12,He was so very seldom. I'm not very there now.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;17;14;12,01;17;38;07,"I don't watch it at all. Hardly. During the day I have. I do have one so far that I watched that this. I try to keep it just did the one because you could really get involved in them all if you let yourself. And I just can't sit during the day and continuously watch show after show after show and at night when they're on food 11 fifth, then sometimes I'll watch a good movie if that comes on."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;17;38;14,01;17;42;19,"But if there isn't a good movie, I don't want to watch it. I just soon read a good novel."
Unknown Interviewer,01;17;42;21,01;17;43;19,Did you watch TV?

Unknown Interviewer,01;21;56;05,01;21;58;25,Larry thought it was a big letdown. Yeah.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;21;58;25,01;22;15;21,"And for, like, when he got back to the States and everything, there was a big deal. So you were in Vietnam. Nobody cared. There was no glory in it. Like in World War Two. All the guys were patted on the back. Maybe, you know, you were in World War two, so nobody acted like it was any big deal at all."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;22;15;24,01;22;22;24,"And especially now, I think you said since they pulled out, it's just, it was a big farce, you know."
Unknown Interviewer,01;22;22;26,01;22;27;15,"Do you think that people have some respect for, for them having. No."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;22;27;17,01;22;33;24,"No, no they don't. That's what they're griping about. It's because they got absolutely no respect for it at all."
Unknown Interviewer,01;22;33;26,01;22;54;00,"Have people even though people like, you know, make a big deal about it for some time, they might give the how do you think it was? Respect them? I don't think so. I don't think so. Because,"
Unknown Interviewer,01;22;54;02,01;23;04;16,If they ever talk about it just having an impact on their lives. Right. I think.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;23;05;06,01;23;18;11,"I know Larry did some work. High school said it affected him emotionally somewhat because, to go over there and see the guys all, shot off."
Unknown Interviewer,01;23;18;11,01;23;25;19,"And so especially when they first got back, I don't think it does now. Not now. They first got back."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;23;25;22,01;23;42;03,"Because he said, all the guys are getting over there and they get shot up and things and killed and so forth, and nobody cared. Just send them home. And then when they were all killed since war, nobody cared. What's that? There was no glory and nobody got paid."
Unknown Interviewer,01;23;42;03,01;23;44;23,I hope.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;23;46;06,01;23;51;01,that's the impression I get from my husband. Anyway.
Unknown Interviewer,01;23;51;03,01;23;53;27,He's out here for such a long.

Unknown Interviewer,01;24;06;29,01;24;20;16,"Yeah, and even the others haven't been to. Seems like either who got left out somehow. But they have their father's house records, and the third person they really didn't affect. People are."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;24;20;18,01;24;22;23,"The depression. Oh, I think it did."
Unknown Interviewer,01;24;22;23,01;24;36;01,"One. Did you hear the fact? Oh, it wasn't a will for the people who live through it. It doesn't seem to be a real fun thing in their lives, right?"
Bonnie Nellsch,01;24;36;04,01;24;57;21,"I don't want to know if anybody, during the depression that I've ever talked to except for, you know, mom tells us stories about how they had it when she. And it was when she was a child. Yeah. When the depression. Yep. And she can remember vividly how it was. Where would you rather get during the depression where they."

Unknown Interviewer,01;25;07;03,01;25;08;23,That's right.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;25;08;26,01;25;20;05,"Because she said that's where they lived. And they lived in a chicken coop at the time during the depression. And that's why she can remember so well, because they didn't have proper food. And she said she can remember once. In fact."
Unknown Interviewer,01;25;20;08,01;25;27;09,They they shared that chicken. I think it was two families. Right. So I didn't of them.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;25;27;12,01;25;37;28,"For the farm. Dad would go out and we didn't have a car or anything means of transportation, but he'd go out every day looking for work, and there was no work. And that way there was no money, no food."
Unknown Interviewer,01;25;38;01,01;25;39;08,And we raised the garden.
Bonnie Nellsch,01;25;39;08,01;25;41;10,"At that time, this was winter."
Bonnie Nellsch,01;25;42;09,01;26;05;20,"And, she said she specifically remembered one day when the minister, some minister, came on horseback and the snow was up to the horse's belly and, he came out with some honey, butter bread.

Bonnie Nellsch,01;52;09;02,01;52;31;06,"That's an experience right there. Especially if you're only 18 years old, you know, and, try to frame right by yourself. The friendliest person wasn't Diego Tremaine, and, he was, an employee at the airport, but now he was really nice. And now that was a complete experience in itself, because Negroes, in case you haven't noticed, are not in this area here."
