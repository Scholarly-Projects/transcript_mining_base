Cathy Naugle,00:04:09:23,00:04:21:24,"So you were fairly early, too. And, you know, when they were married, for a dog, you probably could have been."

Cathy Naugle,00:04:58:20,00:04:59:10,Like two years.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:04:59:10,00:05:05:02,Before she passed away.
Cathy Naugle,00:05:05:04,00:05:15:06,"And this was in Saint Louis, too. Now, this was in California. Oh."
Cathy Naugle,00:05:15:08,00:05:28:03,So it was in California. I'm guessing that she wasn't a rancher's wife or farmer's wife. You didn't know how great. My father filled out a regular job as a welder. Pipefitter.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:05:28:03,00:05:33:19,My mother was just a homemaker.

He was a cook on a boat. Yeah. or like a riverboat. Oh. Like, what steamer? It was one that went up and down the Missouri River."
Cathy Naugle,00:06:31:03,00:06:43:29,"I was going to say that that was around there. I don't know what would be for it. And of course, he was raised on a farm. Okay."
Cathy Naugle,00:06:44:01,00:07:11:19,"Yeah, that was in Arkansas, but he was raised on. Oh, so he's boy went from he was practically raised in Arkansas. They moved to Saint Louis. The jet where he met your mother. Yeah. And then did you come up to California? They moved out of your early? Not too much later than that. I was rural California. So you're more Californian than you are."
Cathy Naugle,00:07:11:22,00:07:35:00,"Very. Okay. Let's see. You have. Give me your sisters and brothers. Give me some for Agent Christine. You want a Latham? Sure. Jones. Oh, and she's 41."

Brenda Fay Lewis,00:08:19:24,00:08:24:26,Oh yeah. Spokane.
Cathy Naugle,00:08:24:28,00:08:53:17,"Spokane. Well, you're 35 and you've got a know where we're going. Yeah I know right. Yeah. It's really surprised. it's just coming to me looking at the day. Just wait a minute. That's nice. Now, you. When you get them all done, you'll still be young enough to enjoy something going on, doing a lot of traveling. Go visiting them."
Cathy Naugle,00:08:53:17,00:09:22:20,"Send them off to different places. okay. Let's say your husband's name. Frank. So. And his birthday today, seven 2031. Okay. And where was he born? Richland County, California. Okay. I was thinking about."
Cathy Naugle,00:09:22:23,00:09:29:22,And when were you married? We finally been married four years.
Cathy Naugle,00:09:29:24,00:10:02:27,"Girl 80 to 71. Okay, so is this. This is second for both of us. Okay. And the oldest boy, he is by his first marriage, but there wasn't the one in the service. Okay? We're not 18. Is my oldest. from your birth experience, from there's. It's difficult. I only make the separation because a lot of people wonder about my age, that there's no separation in our home."
Cathy Naugle,00:10:02:29,00:10:26:10,"I was quite a mom. Yeah, right. Dad? So that's okay. Then it was really accepted, right? That the oldest. Did they get along for too long? They've only had one quite. We got that out of their system. So now they're like, just fine. That's really great that that's, I think it's probably very. And and the people we've interviewed that kind of."
Cathy Naugle,00:10:26:12,00:10:50:23,"We should have brought that up last night. One, no special problems because you probably didn't even, like, brag about that part of bringing up a bunch of. Right. Yeah. Let's see, your husband then. Works in the mail, too. What? What do you call? He's a real staffer. Now, what I was asking you, or I was going to ask you what the what is this card for?"
Cathy Naugle,00:10:50:25,00:11:11:23,"Have you seen post in real fences? If you've seen the post. The wooden rail. Yeah, there's holes in post, If you rail have to be chopped down, you couldn't go. Oh, right. And he, he uses a machine that has double saws on either end of the carriage, perhaps the railing 1 a.m. and on the other end, which makes cuts."
Cathy Naugle,00:11:11:26,00:11:35:06,"Then he throws it over the staff to me. I was about to cut off the excess wood so that the rail comes down. So there's that much fence. there's not much call for fence posts. I didn't realize that people would use them not only around here for a yard, but they also used to have their their, their landlord corrals."
Cathy Naugle,00:11:35:08,00:12:00:29,"I would next year rather long term. That's right. They're using cedar. Do they have to treat, the part that goes in the ground or something? Okay. It's the progressive rock. Oh, it guess I don't know. A lot of people might lacquer it for change of color because it will turn gray. Yeah. So I didn't have that treatment."
Cathy Naugle,00:12:01:01,00:12:27:01,"A rail scarper, Okay, now I've got to ask. How did you. I could ask later, but I'm curious. How did you from California there. How did you to come up here and get into that? You must. I know you weren't doing that down there and lost right. Oh I had that's it's got to be interesting. Well, frankly, I would."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:12:27:01,00:12:35:28,"Go to the grocery business. Right, right. 23 years, the grocery business and 90% grocery store manager. And I was in."
Cathy Naugle,00:12:35:28,00:13:06:05,"The grocery chapter for eight years. So, you know, we have you make a good man. And he opened a new store for his company in a predominantly black area. And I agree that, you know, racial problems which was real difficult would never have survived. You've never ran into that before. And I don't want details. I don't think what it boils down to what they needed."
Cathy Naugle,00:13:06:13,00:13:19:28,"They needed someone to take the rap. So it was Frank. yeah. so we're going to talk about that. Your purpose was invited to go over Prime Point. Oh, wow."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:13:20:00,00:13:26:02,"Yeah, yeah. At that time, it was a virtual recovery. Sure."
Cathy Naugle,00:13:26:04,00:13:46:10,"And I came home from shopping on my day off, and he was home to go and take a week to think it over. And I came home and we bought our property the year before. Oh, up here for retirement years. he was pretty down and I asked him what he wanted to do, but he didn't know. I asked if he wanted to come back home."
Cathy Naugle,00:13:46:10,00:14:14:23,"He said yeah, so so they came up, spent a week trying to find a customer for us in which he couldn't find anything. So he sounded kind of like, you know, job. And all we had was property five was like nothing on. And that was like a year ago. Fabric three year old after three years out with five boys and have really no one and no tap room games or anything."
Cathy Naugle,00:14:14:25,00:14:41:10,"Really. Yeah. Oh, wow. So we came up in store for my first year staff and we didn't care what we could handle. After the work was set up right here or any outside room. Ready? Oh, that's right. You feel there, Frank? Bill? oh, I came back one more. So then how did you get here? Okay. he went to work for the state."
Cathy Naugle,00:14:41:10,00:15:11:25,"Was $50.30 an hour. And, the first winter came and I was for you. Snow, and ran a logging road, bridge and buggy. And you figured out that you had to walk a mile and half the best stuff, so we couldn't handle it. That would be a rugged challenge. I mean, was very muddy, kind of. Yeah. And, so we moved into town the first winter, probably within the next year or the next year."
Cathy Naugle,00:15:11:27,00:15:32:13,"And Barney Frank figured it. The fact it was, so we were looking at trailers and just looking around, and we decided we wanted a house for next week. White House trailer on condition that we sell our property and it found her, And we managed to sell our five acres. There's a lot in between the. Oh, from there."
Cathy Naugle,00:15:32:15,00:15:42:03,"And the house was already built. So we have one of them sold out on the property, and we got $1,000 out of it to get on the trailer."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:15:42:06,00:15:47:12,And then we went to Dan Idaho. They're not.
Cathy Naugle,00:15:47:15,00:16:08:00,"Back. Oh, to where we were. To the down. Yeah. Is that the first time you've worked in there? Yeah yeah yeah yeah I work with Cedar and did you both apply together before now? I'm sure he went down to work with, his best friend. Her. Her never worked with Cedar now before. Oh, that must have really been something."
Cathy Naugle,00:16:08:01,00:16:23:08,"Yeah, well, we're done a lot of things we've never done before. And he. Before we left, he was a craftsman. Frank is not a camper. And time was that to work for the state. Well, he left the state. Got a better job at Parks and Services."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:16:23:08,00:16:28:06,Saint Mary's and he got three races a year.
Cathy Naugle,00:16:28:09,00:17:01:09,"Wow. And he really. And that was the first time he'd done that kind of work. We didn't know one part of a community, but and this was basically our trucks, logging trucks and. But he was only making like $500 a week. Yeah. He wasn't even hiring in the California's economy. That was very difficult with five kids here. And so a friend of ours by the camera, I am a farmer farmer himself."
Cathy Naugle,00:17:01:11,00:17:27:15,"He can't drive anywhere. And so we could stand a separate. So we went with it. Yeah. Trader and worked there for over a year. And the bosses had the business down there. They got here. Yeah. All of that for him because of our church work for her. And we could have been a boss down the middle down there, but that's the way we would work it out."
Cathy Naugle,00:17:27:17,00:17:54:01,"that now closed down. Is that right? So we never show from here, because that now shut down and we would lost everything. Oh, and you would have been just back. Same position. Well, that's really that is unique. That's that's really a drastic change. But we had I mean, I would think so we learned how to carry water and chocolate factory."
Cathy Naugle,00:17:54:07,00:18:14:24,"So when you came here he still did. He did his job first and then you did. Well see I don't cross our. Oh, I really do. Except that. Is that right? Or I mean how he gets paid $0.10 apiece for each trail. So I see so you're I just go up there and work with you and I cross road."
Cathy Naugle,00:18:14:26,00:18:36:15,"I'm not. I'm not on the payroll. They don't mind. Oh, no. Wow. Now there's no problem here. I, I've never cut myself so much. the boy have I knew if they work with him or two in the summertime when I don't work crank together, I can count in the summer when the kids are there out of school."
Cathy Naugle,00:18:36:15,00:19:00:28,"And they work, too. Yeah, across from it. It's a family affair. Yeah. They don't get paid for work. I we okay. If they have another job and then they, they dropped out. If they work on the rail track, it's just because it's a one man job. I see. That's really that's that's it. I do make way to meet you."
Cathy Naugle,00:19:01:00,00:19:36:04,"To meet your me? I'm really surprised. I'm impressed. Well, let's see, let me get down. Your children's names and their birth date. And half an April I forgot. Oh, let's see the years. Okay. 1956. And he's the oldest. He's the one that's in the high car. April 11th. Is it? And it's just before my mathematics. The 14th of the 11."
Cathy Naugle,00:19:36:04,00:19:41:21,"Oh, and then there's two."
Cathy Naugle,00:19:41:23,00:19:42:17,This is.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:19:42:21,00:19:47:14,"February 3rd, 1950."
Cathy Naugle,00:19:47:16,00:19:48:19,And he said.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:19:48:20,00:19:56:02,He would be in school with the junior school.
Cathy Naugle,00:19:56:04,00:20:06:15,"Okay, Curtis, they're all close. Oh, okay. I was born March 21st."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:20:06:17,00:20:15:05,1960. I was a freshman special.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:20:15:07,00:20:40:08,"He was Craig. Okay. And he was born August 14th, 1962. Okay, so let's get. He was born June 11th."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:20:40:11,00:20:41:14,okay.
Cathy Naugle,00:20:41:17,00:20:55:16,"Let's see. Maybe I'll stop here. Do you want to, you get too close to the shelter? It was an accident. Yeah, yeah, it happened, but really, don't."
Cathy Naugle,00:20:55:18,00:21:21:18,"Know. Let's see. Yeah, well, we got we got all that part done. education from state. What? How many graduate school did you think? It's very confusing. I quit school in my sophomore year, and then after three children, I. That's all. That's like last night, our presentation. and I went to some school with."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:21:21:18,00:21:29:03,"The high school kids because we're at this church for her, to night school, and she wouldn't get to go to the restaurant."
Cathy Naugle,00:21:29:03,00:21:49:29,"I don't have a. Yeah, but I finished all the required such. And you got. Yeah. This is it. piece of paper. Yeah. So do you have to do that to take correspondence? Or, I could probably go to night school just to get a piece of paper because I passed on my to. Oh, but you still need to do it to have that report."
Cathy Naugle,00:21:50:02,00:22:21:00,"Baker. I have to work. It's funny, you just couldn't get because you passed the test for that. That's why it. Your sister and her school, they each have each state. No, it may be different than your mind right here. Yeah. You should. I think I have a friend that was learning Spokane and her counselor said to come to Portland to take her G.E.D. because of some relaxation of the requirements."
Cathy Naugle,00:22:21:00,00:22:24:25,So I do know that I had passed.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:22:24:25,00:22:30:09,"What they told me at that time that I was fairly high scores, and I think my."
Cathy Naugle,00:22:30:12,00:22:46:00,"Overall score was 85. Oh, wow. Why don't you do it? Yeah. If you're worth checking into it, you might already have it. Not me. You might not know it. I tested. Yeah, perfect for you the first time you quit after two years."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:22:46:00,00:23:05:21,"So, sophomore. Sophomore."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:23:05:24,00:23:10:09,Sure.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:23:10:11,00:23:12:10,Let's see.
Cathy Naugle,00:23:12:12,00:23:39:13,"Now, just how would you rest your skills? What can work in home skills? And out of the 46, how would I listen? Yeah, what can I do? You have to do. Well, the grocery checker publication or her, probably a teacher by. It like I'm going to be my our my avocation. Okay. Yeah. Teacher my avocation."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:23:39:15,00:23:46:02,But and I swear work I don't like this work.
Cathy Naugle,00:23:46:05,00:24:21:19,"And I work like the bartender. Really? That. When was that? All right. I ran out last year. I became a licensed five to do in Idaho. In Idaho? Where did you work? Or. what else can I do? Oh, I can catch you. So I just like shakes. Okay. That's okay for that. People crowd shakers. Do they, the things that you cut off do they make goes into shape or they're on, like, very small, like four by a little bit,"
Cathy Naugle,00:24:21:21,00:24:51:23,"I feel like when I make chips and, like, do I put that right now? They just they goes on on her. What? So. And then what you're doing and I. What do you call the. Oh, I guess you could call. Probably real scarper. Okay. It's it's just the finished product. It's a real disgusting."
Cathy Naugle,00:24:51:26,00:24:58:03,"But those types of things that I can do and harder to make, like. And then when you came up here."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:24:58:05,00:25:03:02,"You learned,"
Cathy Naugle,00:25:03:04,00:25:26:01,"I learned the door thing. Yeah, sure I do. In California. I was just across the river then up here. I don't know, how about every damn corner or every apartment? Everybody have talked to? Can. I haven't done it yet. And I've been drilling on every deal to it. I just really don't like that. Did you. Do you like it?"
Cathy Naugle,00:25:26:04,00:25:49:00,"I drove the time-consuming. Yeah. That's it. Julia just started, and she said she figures it would take about three years before she got her investment back out. I can't really get used to doing it. So she doesn't spend. It's mine, and I. So I like I got quite a few of my shirts. Yeah, shirts. There's a lot of turnover, actually."
Cathy Naugle,00:25:49:02,00:26:15:12,"I'm in Kansas out of scraps. I have a really big box. Fastest car, I think. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That, that that is name slaps is a good idea. Yeah. If I didn't have a background sheet, I don't need it. But I just put the different cultures. But yeah. this was one of Craig shirts right where I keep doing and the coordinated colors like that."
Cathy Naugle,00:26:15:12,00:26:39:06,"So you can use it now before I picture fucking right out this they I bet they do. They appreciate it. All right. And off the shirts I mean. That town's a real thing. We have to look. Boy, I was to like the average height of an actual motorcycle. Take the shape left. Yeah. okay. I found some of our things."
Cathy Naugle,00:26:39:09,00:27:05:00,"they're really good work, and I know for sure things are going for you. Very little complaint. Do you think they've gotten that way more since you came up here or were they in California? Big difference. Now they'd like to. I really do. Like. I'm glad I was there for the whole family. Right. Because we'd like to."
Cathy Naugle,00:27:05:01,00:27:30:17,"Fishing what we have. Were you, would you say you were very much into the California lifestyle when you were down there, right? We we party. I mean, on our days off, just to make sure. And, that was away like a day off. You have to have dresses. Go out with your friends, go, go, go to party."
Cathy Naugle,00:27:30:17,00:27:58:27,"Yeah. And, that didn't stop. Actually, I figured out how to figure out how to break those habits. but lack of money will break a lot from. And that'll help. where you, were you religious? Were you involved in. We like Christians. Now, before we can get back regarding Christians from a year ago and February. March for free."
Cathy Naugle,00:27:59:01,00:28:22:04,"And you're going for for me. And each of our workers made a commitment to Christ is that, is is the hammer, isn't it? The hammer to lose track? I've got so I couldn't I got that from. This is not an ordained minister. Part. So that is that had some he let to mama. I read some things I did."
Cathy Naugle,00:28:22:06,00:28:34:25,"I used to work related, maybe not related, but, for lack of a better word, I hope you understand the word religion, but Christianity is different from a personal person."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:28:34:28,00:28:39:19,"Yeah, right. It's not what you can't do."
Cathy Naugle,00:28:39:22,00:29:03:07,"That's it. That's a really good way to put it that it's. We're not stopped from doing anything. Take that off of your statement. Yeah. That's, I like that grandma there. Frank found it in one of our books, which was great. And Christ did not give us the right to reclaim the liberty to do this. We are. And that's appropriate for anyone, right?"
Cathy Naugle,00:29:03:09,00:29:23:25,"Yeah, it is. And it tone out things right. If you can look at and say, yeah. And then or you can take them more serious ones, I like I like this lady around here. Well, it's amazing because before Christ was in our lives, we were like back over, like everything. Yeah, the things of the world, but the most important things in our lives."
Cathy Naugle,00:29:23:25,00:29:53:14,"And we strive to get the job and everything else. But that's practical for our lives working for you. That's the most important. Yeah, not nearly as important, but the spiritual aspect of life and learning path, career, the way we're supposed to live without having to go back, give up our future. Because yeah, you're right again. Or or not caring about our neighbor."
Cathy Naugle,00:29:53:16,00:29:59:18,"If you are, do spiritual well-being because a lot of people don't believe."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:29:59:21,00:30:05:02,"That they to get out, but they want to. And that's"
Cathy Naugle,00:30:05:04,00:30:33:20,"I look at people that have don't have Christ in their lives, and they're on a one way street that, that woman I regret this morning had similar feelings. She said, if you have a goal, it's a lot easier to to get through some of the things that ordinarily would of you stopped. So we've been through things, lack of money, but Christ, in fact, provided for us to break our faith."
Cathy Naugle,00:30:33:23,00:31:01:24,"That would discourage a lot of people. And it's amazing. I mean, we don't drink anymore. It isn't because we stopped, which is like, because I. So it wasn't it. It's not such a matter of giving things up. It's just things have changed. Important priorities. If you don't want to rank smoke for 30 years. Yeah, you know, a lot of people what they go through, I just quit again last week."
Cathy Naugle,00:31:01:26,00:31:30:23,"We got smacked bankrupt too quick after that. that they cannot get what can help him because he tried to quit on, his own self effort. He couldn't do it. He snuck around. And that's why I'm kind of the Christ is not going to come to Christ. He quit. And what did your tax cigarets and pocket? He never reach for another cigaret from that day."
Cathy Naugle,00:31:30:25,00:31:57:12,"And he never reached for one who's never happy. Reach it. He's never had a candy cane substitute. He wasn't cranky or crabby. It's just because he was never smoked for life. His lungs are absolutely clear. There's no doubt about, that my people think, well, that, you know, there was no self-efficacy. Try self-efficacy. That's, awfully good advertisment."
Cathy Naugle,00:31:57:12,00:32:24:19,"Just it for nothing. You know that. Let me see. I think actually, by going through your skills, we went through a lot of the jobs you counted in grocery checker, in fact. And now what you're doing, are there other or were there other jobs that you had no doubt about? Covers. But the grocery checker, you were for several years, a year."
Cathy Naugle,00:32:24:22,00:32:30:21,Did you go to that school simply to have that?
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:32:30:23,00:32:36:18,"So you had I mean, you probably,"
Cathy Naugle,00:32:36:20,00:32:52:23,Would do rather.
Cathy Naugle,00:32:52:25,00:33:22:06,"you could have you could take other jobs because I could understand. That's, fascinating. Yeah. Well, let's see, how about, what would you say? All right. Now, this it would be interesting. I've heard some of the other answer your question, but, Christy, I was going to ask you what groups in clubs and societies, if you want to sell one to people, you have this young."
Cathy Naugle,00:33:22:14,00:33:29:08,"It's a children's children's charity, Christian group."
Cathy Naugle,00:33:29:10,00:33:36:11,And it's just something that you organized for the two of you. I think marketing.
Cathy Naugle,00:33:36:13,00:33:58:28,"And are there some other groups? I think at the end of the lesson, we got two. Oh, the back of the young people. Well, young married, teenagers. but I don't want to because I'm swamped. I guess, yes, it it would probably take all the time you want to give it. Thanks a lot."
Cathy Naugle,00:33:59:02,00:34:07:24,"Yeah. How about, hobbies and the parents that you up right."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:34:07:26,00:34:16:06,"Here in, I have some traveling."
Cathy Naugle,00:34:16:09,00:34:45:11,"And I like working out. Oh, I'm on a yes. I was to put that down because. Did you make that? Oh, what? How do you like to write story? I like to read about people. Have you ever. Is this. I write some poetry. Oh, I'll have to look at that. Have you ever said anything you're in? No, I haven't started keeping encouraged, but, I never feel it."
Cathy Naugle,00:34:45:12,00:34:56:17,"It's over there for you. I would encourage you to try it. Just. Just to see what comes out. Did you, have you done that for a long time? Well, just. I've written off, and."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:34:56:17,00:35:03:21,I think that's just for her. Give short stories.
Cathy Naugle,00:35:03:24,00:35:25:01,"Now or I'm mean active directory. They did that, I did you all let me read it in here. So we'll have it on Facebook. What is it. This is my favorite. So we first met."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:35:25:03,00:35:30:03,Linda. You could stop it if I called you.
Cathy Naugle,00:35:30:05,00:35:46:11,"Did you? You read this? Maybe the story that I came up with for her. And if I let her quickly. And her. I had written the column on Wade, California, my sister in the back seat of the car and said, just get something."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:35:46:16,00:35:50:21,Here. oh. So you like to travel?
Cathy Naugle,00:35:50:23,00:36:13:24,"Like there are books out, handbooks. You know, like, I think Writer's Handbook is the name. The one has a lot of places, you know, publisher, but you could also just look in magazines, look to the front wall, you know, and and a lot of our have sent letters to Reader's Digest. Yeah. I didn't know where to rally. You just should find out."
Cathy Naugle,00:36:13:26,00:36:49:03,"Have you ever gotten any awards? honors, ribbons, enemies, fairs or anything? What's the name? You? Club. That's because you have. Those are your group you've got from the back. The that that counts. Now, these questions, let me just tell you beforehand if there's any that you don't want to talk about, let me know. these are some kind of general questions that we deviate from a lot, but, we like to ask everybody some of the same ones so we can compare."
Cathy Naugle,00:36:49:05,00:37:18:02,"Now, you you're being a really good place to compare to. What would you say are some of the advantages and disadvantages of living in an urban area and a rural area? Some of the air quality for my urban area would be. You know, my personal feelings about Park for the shopping for her, favorite better bargains as far as purchase."
Cathy Naugle,00:37:18:04,00:37:22:25,"So, you know, that's a good quote that you, you know, because the major."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:37:22:28,00:37:29:02,Concern in most people's minds today has taken over in part of the day.
Cathy Naugle,00:37:29:05,00:37:39:22,You would have to drive is by 45. Yeah. disadvantages out there. I thought you might say that you to reaction.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:37:39:22,00:37:45:01,To together with the three.
Cathy Naugle,00:37:45:03,00:38:03:03,"You mean even in a family, you're just going berserk? No, just too many people have to close the area, which I. That many people pack the store always brings problems. The people that have come through have registered you prices for family and friends."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:38:03:06,00:38:08:21,"People here because you never. And of course, there's always."
Cathy Naugle,00:38:08:24,00:38:21:10,Where there's more people. Those are my problem. That's right. Because there's not enough area for children to move in or to be able to play ball.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:38:21:12,00:38:28:08,"I, I'm not a dog breeder with that. I could go on and on about it."
Cathy Naugle,00:38:28:11,00:38:32:29,"Yeah. Well, how would you compare? the life of."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:38:32:29,00:38:39:04,"A rural woman compared with American? And again, you're in a position."
Cathy Naugle,00:38:39:04,00:39:17:21,"To have experience both. Well, of course, an urban woman, depending on where she works or not. As a matter of fact, if you work, it's. She has generally all over automatic. Thank you for, dryers. Dishwashers are required by corporate council and, babysitters. If if you actually work for a much greater variety. Teacher matters. Because I know when I worked, I heard many big cities."
Cathy Naugle,00:39:17:24,00:39:30:28,"that was required there. as far as work goes, work and home work together for anyone who is busy. in an urban community, if you are working."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:39:30:28,00:39:38:06,"To, in my back, a few more things to do to get out there."
Cathy Naugle,00:39:38:09,00:39:50:28,"First line right behind I work. I have other things I have to keep up regard for, the boys to share. They do not stay home and wash dishes."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:39:51:01,00:39:55:12,We all go back to stripping down there.
Cathy Naugle,00:39:55:17,00:40:12:25,And this is something they've always done to or just always done their own to do it. Always going to sit there. It's just hard when you think about it. It's always been there. but a rural woman.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:40:12:27,00:40:16:24,Might have a garden for the first time.
Cathy Naugle,00:40:16:27,00:40:51:19,"Yeah. Have you have your current garden? I did not, yeah, I have, I have something else to tackle this year. Last year wasn't there wasn't much there that I'm not telling. I said Harvest Garden except for one year. Yeah, that's a good goal, right. Well, do you think that a woman has as many opportunities to. As we were talking last night, that to find herself, to discover what she wants and who she is in a rural setting."
Cathy Naugle,00:40:51:21,00:41:29:26,"I mean, do you think she has more in whatever you say? I think I don't think it makes a difference. We don't. I think it all comes from I think we need it. We have to find ourselves before circumstances don't make the what you are or what situation where you really are a complete person. Oh yeah, different from what you are, where you where you do well, do you think there it's more likely that somebody will experience troubles in one place, or as far as just troubles in general?"
Cathy Naugle,00:41:29:28,00:41:51:13,"Yeah. trouble finding their identity? I don't know. I really don't think so. Just from my own opinion, I don't think. I think you either have to find yourself from within. Doesn't matter where you live. I think you could find yourself if you're."
Cathy Naugle,00:41:51:15,00:42:18:21,"Okay. That's it. That's a good, good answer. how do your family life now? Of course. It's changed from your parents in California, but how would you compare your family today with your family when you were a child? But. But are there any things that are similar? Have you kept anything that you remember that similar you like to her, or is it radically different?"
Cathy Naugle,00:42:18:24,00:42:25:26,"Oh no. There's a lot of things that I think, share this background that you learned that to."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:42:25:26,00:42:36:14,"Where I learned that, Not that. That's the same."
Cathy Naugle,00:42:36:16,00:42:59:18,"respect for God. How about, the position of the children or your family? Do you think, it sounds like you're. This is a pretty democratic form where your kids probably get as much to say in decision making as, you know, they certainly allowed it to be. Yeah, we they're allowed to discuss the."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:42:59:18,00:43:07:02,"Farm and, discuss what they think is the, work on my my."
Cathy Naugle,00:43:07:04,00:43:39:18,"As we see our they're able to understand their own. Sure. What crosses along the line. but the ultimate answer always comes back. Parents. Is that similar to the way you were brought up? If you get. Actually, our children, are allowed more freedom. That area if you have to go Iowa. we allow more discretion for my children, and I would very rule discussion that it has to do with,"
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:43:39:20,00:43:44:11,Secret. Yes or no and no. Fine.
Cathy Naugle,00:43:44:14,00:44:15:25,"But we have our second question. her right. Never outright disobedience. Yeah. We don't go after every child. And how about, comparing your position in the family, in your mother's position? What shape do you think you have greater freedom of expression. And do you have more equality with your husband than your mother has, or. No. I'm, my my personal."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:44:15:28,00:44:18:26,She she did.
Cathy Naugle,00:44:18:29,00:44:23:01,I don't think she ever felt subservient to me. I don't feel.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:44:23:04,00:44:30:09,"Like I've never felt that. I work with people like,"
Cathy Naugle,00:44:30:11,00:44:45:24,"Well, you know, get her right across from with that ax. Yeah, yeah. No. I my mother is father, and her mother worked with my father. It was strictly. He worked outside the home. She work in the house."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:44:45:29,00:44:50:23,"This was their environment that,"
Cathy Naugle,00:44:50:25,00:45:05:04,"She worked as hard as I could. Yeah, she had a problem. She did? there was never dealt with darkness over back."
Cathy Naugle,00:45:05:06,00:45:11:12,The opportunity or the necessity never rose. As far as I remember. After work with her.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:45:11:14,00:45:20:08,"And our kids, typically, we have plenty of road faculty, right? There."
Cathy Naugle,00:45:20:10,00:45:56:07,"We, we were talking after one of our last trip. Started talking or kicking butt about the fact that so many of the women in the smaller communities would say, I don't understand these women that are saying you're unfulfilled. You know, I'm I don't feel subservient or unfulfilled or useless or whatever. And we kind of thought that one of the reasons might be that that women, women in rural communities had more they were making contributions that they could see more than the women that were in the cities."
Cathy Naugle,00:45:56:07,00:46:16:22,"And, you know, especially the ones that weren't working, that they didn't feel like they were doing their thing. Have you do you, when you were in California, of course you were working, too. But do you feel, better about the working that you're doing now that we see more contribution? Yeah, I went to that."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:46:16:27,00:46:24:05,"Did you go back and look back at. Sure. But, you know, again, it wasn't my circumstance."
Cathy Naugle,00:46:24:07,00:46:38:12,"It it was, it was I was sitting everybody was saying that women weren't for help and things have listened. And I don't do that. And if your sex life wasn't just right."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:46:38:14,00:46:45:26,"All right, all right. Okay. I remember her work,"
Cathy Naugle,00:46:45:28,00:46:54:04,"Which created a whole new set of problems, to go out trying to be fulfilled, which can cause a lot of problems."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:46:54:08,00:47:00:07,"In your home. So, so I remember, and I have to get."
Cathy Naugle,00:47:00:07,00:47:19:28,"Up and tell my screen protector for that, because I don't, but I. I realize that I've always been a social person. I did not want to. And since then, I don't need anything. I really I don't feel I'm fulfilled. I don't have what I lack."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:47:20:01,00:47:26:11,For right now for college and find.
Cathy Naugle,00:47:26:13,00:47:45:04,I did get a part time job. I think that's what a person. Because I don't have the time to dwell on whether or not they're were fulfilled. That I'm too busy. Great time for my husband.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:47:45:06,00:47:49:03,"working for him,"
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:47:49:05,00:48:01:10,"Which I work for. I know I spend a lot more time here. I couldn't work or, I don't have to be anywhere."
Cathy Naugle,00:48:01:13,00:48:07:16,"And they're definitely back in my life, I mean, as far as that goes. But they're not anything."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:48:07:16,00:48:13:04,"They're trying to make you think, but."
Cathy Naugle,00:48:13:06,00:48:40:13,"I, I that sounds really familiar. One of the characters that we didn't do last night, we were in Kansas, one of the pioneer volunteers. Stuff. Yeah. There were other things I want to do. I want to go to Hawaii. I wanted to go through really quick, quick flowers. But first I wanted to homestead, and I've done that. But in fact, I if we had done that presentation, I think you would have identified what came up, because it's kind of it sounds similar."
Cathy Naugle,00:48:40:16,00:48:57:20,"Well, how about for recreation in nature can do do most of your activities as a family or do you have many things you do by yourself? What kind of things? I used to do a lot of fishing."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:48:57:23,00:49:00:07,I've. I've grown older. I.
Cathy Naugle,00:49:00:09,00:49:19:20,"I've lost my eight year old. Older? Yeah. I have my instinct here. it's gone somewhere. I, I think I could shoot a deer. I would have to look. It would be been that, That's what. That's what? The last four. Six. Yeah. Yeah, it's really starting to soften process."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:49:19:22,00:49:32:28,"Then, having. The classes about other things that are interesting. You don't look like, they're not the things that are on the planet."
Cathy Naugle,00:49:33:00,00:49:45:25,"How about time magazine and newspapers do that? scratch linear. Always like to do like phases you take from a landscape or it's a question of the question, but we don't force. Well, we've got building."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:49:45:25,00:49:50:21,"Strength child crap. Okay, but I don't."
Cathy Naugle,00:49:50:21,00:50:17:01,"Have time to read. I read my Bible and I read, Christian oriented literature, if it's helped me spiritually. And so others like my read. But their problems to be able to relate well, for instance, women's magazines, I don't know, let's say on Family Circle and how to make casseroles. Oh, I think that's read across one rip it out."
Cathy Naugle,00:50:17:01,00:50:43:23,"But I think magazines I know. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. How about, television are there do you watch it very much if I'm home, what kind of programs are whatever program we write? I don't know, picture. Okay. I like romance. okay. how about Mary Tyler Moore? She works there. I enjoy her. All right. Thanks for the program."
Cathy Naugle,00:50:43:26,00:51:00:23,"Yeah. How about, let's see, an awful lot of police stories I don't watch. maybe it comes too close to reality. yeah. Do you want a gallery with a photograph? Right. But I really think."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:51:00:23,00:51:06:28,That you can do it here. Yeah.
Cathy Naugle,00:51:07:00,00:51:30:12,"They don't have any. They don't have my children. And the more TV I see, the less likely to watch or even claim to play with your, Let's see. You and your husband. What are the most frequent things that he asks you about? A week in court?"
Cathy Naugle,00:51:30:14,00:51:52:11,"You'd be surprised. Some women have been married for 40 years. Do you think you win as well? Or rather than everything, like, you know, I try to calm down. Are you leaving me there? Are you honey, how'd it go? Which could make you work while we work together? All that's right, I forgot. If there's anything to discuss, we discuss."
Cathy Naugle,00:51:52:11,00:52:24:21,"What can you do? You do? Right here. Yeah, I know we were talking about separating job and home and not putting you problems to work when you work together. But. But you do talk about. Yeah. I think we have problems, but I think it's normal. Yeah. We put together pretty well here a row. economic. You know, finances in the family are both of you about like the other to know what's going on right now?"
Cathy Naugle,00:52:24:24,00:52:44:16,"he's not crazy about it. it's been real good for him, because you can see where the money go. I'm well aware of where it goes, because I can it for so long. I used to more in California. Yeah, well, I was just taking it over the last, like, was really wanting to put it back."
Cathy Naugle,00:52:44:19,00:52:51:09,but it's it's been a good experience for me. It was very good experience for me because I've always been independent.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:52:51:11,00:52:56:03,"From where I'm at. Right? Like where everything go, you know."
Cathy Naugle,00:52:56:06,00:53:03:07,"The one time to go, I know where I've been. Yeah, that's been very beneficial for me."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:53:03:09,00:53:11:06,"To have to do that for my husband. But I did trust. Yeah. All right. Yeah, that's."
Cathy Naugle,00:53:11:14,00:53:40:29,"That's a turnabout I am hearing. You have to do that to do it myself. That's where being an independent person. Person, it's easy to be okay with my brother. No, it isn't to me. Not to another person to try different. But it's very beneficial. That's it, that's it, I am. But you put that. I gotta remember that. Well, we'll have it down on tape, but,"
Cathy Naugle,00:53:41:01,00:53:52:12,Let's see. Have you ever thought of what you would do if you're suddenly left alone with your kid? Or something? A hypothetical situation? Yeah.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:53:52:12,00:54:03:03,"We never amount to anything. Sure, because it comes up. we have a friend. I've been in jail because you're not leaving without me. You're not."
Cathy Naugle,00:54:03:05,00:54:15:14,"You're going home. I'm going with you because we're just strangers here, you know, from, nowhere I've got first, but, I haven't got a great backup."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:54:15:16,00:54:22:11,"Because my face. Face. I'm not that that I fell in love with you, guy."
Cathy Naugle,00:54:22:14,00:54:48:20,"Whatever is necessary, wherever we want taken. And I do know that you're going strong, right? I don't care if something should happen. 3000 people would take over if they. And they were found to go back there. I know that you come up with them. They're not giving you a medical certificate. Different names right now, but that's part of it."
Cathy Naugle,00:54:48:22,00:54:52:00,but I know that they would take over.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:54:52:03,00:54:58:12,"And I often. No, there's no I don't worry about it."
Cathy Naugle,00:54:58:15,00:55:21:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you have a right to be visit. Okay. Now I, I hope I can verify you, since you're both here, but what can you tell me about your expectations before you got married and have a chance to change? I believe that you feel differently about marriage than you did at other periods in my life."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:55:21:28,00:55:29:18,"For for. Yeah. Wow. To five. Back off. It's too hard for better, right? Because the only thing that."
Cathy Naugle,00:55:29:20,00:55:31:14,We find is.

Cathy Naugle,00:55:46:29,00:56:00:21,"That, You take it. That takes mature person to. And you have to microscopic pictures down there. That's before you can write."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:56:00:21,00:56:09:25,A book for trouble. People think you can be able to get. If you're.
Cathy Naugle,00:56:09:28,00:56:11:06,Worried about what.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:56:11:06,00:56:29:14,"Am I going to go back and do that started with your car back to the farm for somebody. so I this is my first marriage before coming back to, when."
Cathy Naugle,00:56:29:15,00:56:31:26,"You were single for quite a long time, not long."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:56:31:26,00:56:37:01,"Ago. Ago, biological protection and all that."
Cathy Naugle,00:56:37:01,00:56:40:22,Must be original love story. there's been a lot.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:56:40:22,00:56:47:15,"Of adjustments in our life due to our own back, but no different from."
Cathy Naugle,00:56:47:18,00:57:08:24,"Them with our demand. Sure. that it's really been, the run of the mill marriages, second marriage to family. It's really kind from a basic. It sounds like things have greatly. We've had certain."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:57:08:24,00:57:28:24,"Problems with the two different children. But, yeah, I think everything will come up in the to up there. Frank and I can just sound without going overboard on separating my children."
Cathy Naugle,00:57:28:27,00:57:34:05,"yeah, you have. And there's always that problem, right? We're having some of it."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:57:34:08,00:57:46:03,"And not being comfortable going to relationship with the children. Have, which we're thankful for. It's good to see you again. Sure we're right."
Cathy Naugle,00:57:46:05,00:58:11:15,"And in fact, I noticed the voice of the truck, if you're more eager to talk about it, which creates a little jealousy in my car. Yeah, I can work that the other way. It sounds like a, one of the better problems. Kind of a positive. Oh, really? Yeah. It's something that I want. And then when I get it, I'm not too sure what it's like letting go."
Cathy Naugle,00:58:11:17,00:58:35:18,"Yeah, letting go after the truck. Do you? Good. Let me ask you about the future. Do you anticipate that you'll experience the the empty nest feeling? I mean, when you when the last one leave, do you think you will then not know what to do with yourself or do you. Oh, I think I know what to do with myself."
Cathy Naugle,00:58:35:18,00:58:57:10,"I know I probably there that I will go a bit long. It took a while before public, but yeah. Oh, a certain amount of time from this year would have. Yeah, I'm watching it. I know it's attractive and going."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:58:57:10,00:59:03:09,It is. I just can't trust it's not less wonderful. I learned.
Cathy Naugle,00:59:03:11,00:59:05:20,"I learned, and I know it was for me."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:59:05:23,00:59:14:21,"I'm a little more, hopefully we'll both have children of about about or I think will be able."
Cathy Naugle,00:59:14:21,00:59:30:20,"To draw from our backlog of experiences to have them. How do you feel about, the future for, the boys? Are you pretty optimistic? Well, each of the boys so far has a certain area of service study for their work, and we encourage them."
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:59:30:20,00:59:37:19,"To join forces because their obligation as a country, they."
Cathy Naugle,00:59:37:19,00:59:39:10,Are respected.
Brenda Fay Lewis,00:59:39:12,00:59:52:05,"Which is kind of unique in a lot of areas today. Down country, this is where we are. But that's what we're here to do."
Cathy Naugle,00:59:52:08,01:00:07:16,"I have a little counsel, But as far as if you choose where courage. You even have to go to the service to use the facilities, the service there in order to learn a trade."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:00:07:19,01:00:17:22,"Or to spread your education and use it for their own benefit so that they'll be able to be useful and productive, but not just."
Cathy Naugle,01:00:17:25,01:01:02:16,"Not knowing what they want to do right there. Yeah, I think there's a lot of difference between the service and the service to be to the point where they don't want, the two people who are very market at that time, and it's not a graph. Right. So, we have a pretty good balance of opportunities. Okay. I know the answer before I ask you this, but I asked this morning, so I want to ask you to, how do you think there's, meaning to another question, but what do you how do you feel about about this the idea that maybe marriage dynamics investigation or maybe it's not a workable institution."
Cathy Naugle,01:01:02:18,01:01:07:18,"I like it. two years ago, I would have spent some."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:01:07:21,01:01:18:07,"Time I could not work with our the, But I can't say that I don't think."
Cathy Naugle,01:01:18:09,01:01:33:05,"I don't think the whole concept of being married this time now, the commitment to do, maybe the rigorous pressure following a lot of random questions were not necessary."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:01:33:07,01:01:40:07,"but a man or woman has children, right? About that piece of paper out right back."
Cathy Naugle,01:01:40:09,01:02:14:08,"So if if parents and some of the boys or all of them or one of them, were to live with someone, could you could you accept that I will not be my control perfect in this because they know they're good in the short term breaking work. We will go through this with our responsibility before God. And so they know we are responsible and they know that promiscuity and marriage are acceptable."
Cathy Naugle,01:02:14:11,01:02:47:27,"So I don't have that double standard and all that. Do it. If they want to break that barrel, I'm going to show this to one of them I had not before. Have you talked with them about that? They haven't talked very similar. But we don't allow them because you don't. How has that presented any problem? Have you had to know because they had to decide your classes before I could take them out of class, because you, why do you do you did you,"
Cathy Naugle,01:02:47:29,01:03:15:19,"I'm sure you'll be able to tell me I don't have any more questions in 2015. So let's talk about, our morals, our society today, their moral. rules of life. And they want a common corporate environment. they don't care what they come from with multiple sex partners or the crazy thing wrong with that. Trying it out before you get married, you make it doesn't work."
Cathy Naugle,01:03:15:20,01:03:22:29,So what? the Bible teaches the Word of God says represent the.
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:03:23:04,01:03:26:13,We don't want to talk and talk.
Cathy Naugle,01:03:26:15,01:03:52:27,"And do you feel them that, that it because it's a crucial age for them. You don't want them exposed to it even though they might come back to their to a Christian viewpoint. It's like, well, it isn't being exposed to it. you know, they teach you. Yeah, they're trying to cover. That thing on the top of their own body."
Cathy Naugle,01:03:53:00,01:04:02:08,"and do you think that it is they just now, God created a body for Christ that we recognize the things and our questions."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:04:02:08,01:04:09:15,Arise for an answer straight from the phone store.
Cathy Naugle,01:04:09:17,01:04:38:22,"Can be very straight forward and ready to give a quick answer. It's polite, but, we try to teach them respect for a fact based marketing group or, you have to remove yourself from something and some."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:04:38:25,01:04:40:13,When you had an.
Cathy Naugle,01:04:40:15,01:05:02:19,"Taken out of class or how did you handle it? You go down to school and I come and ask them for teaching sex education because you. Right. I like everything to discuss that. We're in theirs. Oh I see, so he first came to you, right? He said I don't like the conflict. Go kill innocent. But we asked why?"
Cathy Naugle,01:05:02:22,01:05:29:08,"Are you sure? Because we always feel like there's two sides. Yeah. And so I, I called the school and asked if they teach accepted courses and said that they're not afraid to fire on the officer. But I will send the girl from primary school. So if you send it home and is a sex education person, but there's never intermingle, right."
Cathy Naugle,01:05:29:09,01:05:56:17,"So but, her that is under a different name. There's sex information there, right, right. And this type of thing. And, I wrote a letter to teachers. Since I work, it's difficult. Sure. Going back to parents who did this in Saint Mary's was, holding that we were Christians and explained it to them. So we realized what that meant for our writing process."
Cathy Naugle,01:05:56:17,01:06:22:16,"Christian. So have no in the next and it we talked to such patient when it comes to our children after we do we didn't say anything. We want to create not only just the sexual aspect, but Frank, the draft tract department document. We haven't really thought that necessary for a child to know how to inject recommend doing so."
Cathy Naugle,01:06:22:18,01:06:25:16,"if you haven't had the idea, we very likely do not."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:06:25:16,01:06:32:00,"Try after you. Very, curious type of track, but it's crazy."
Cathy Naugle,01:06:32:03,01:06:53:15,"And I worded the letter expressly for her, requested to come back here because they would take our back and put it in a special class. Is by yourself or with another teacher, and also help with the psychological trauma for her, which she wrote."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:06:53:15,01:06:57:10,In a statement regarding the lesser of two evils.
Cathy Naugle,01:06:57:12,01:07:11:18,"The longer we discussed it with pregnancy. So to the library, part. Oh, do you know, were there other parents that did the same thing or. I'm having had different the vast majority of school drive."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:07:11:19,01:07:19:11,Or residential school. And as long as we we got this girl removed from our responsibility.
Cathy Naugle,01:07:19:14,01:08:06:14,"Yeah, yeah. gosh, I there's so much more I could go on with. I guess I know one thing, and and it comes to mind, Ian, there's so much that when you when you talk, you say we often and but you still do you feel you have a separate identity and from your is I mean, I don't feel that I lost my identity, but I say we because for years it just got to be, I can't separate them from Frank because they're supposed to be one."
Cathy Naugle,01:08:06:16,01:08:07:11,If I have my.
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:08:07:11,01:08:12:25,"Wife and we our kids were ready to train. Really? Come together for the purpose, right?"
Cathy Naugle,01:08:12:25,01:08:46:24,"I mean, if I'm going to be a separate individual and if my life react to that and work my way properly in the middle of the night, happy agree. Or with the matter of it, sharing the marriage might be what she wrote in her comments. Okay, I guess the only other thing I, that I really want to ask is, well, two things."
Cathy Naugle,01:08:46:27,01:09:28:00,"What? Maybe we talked about this last night. What advice would you give a young woman who's moving or a young woman, any age? Woman really is moving to a rural area from an urban area like you did. Well, from my own experience, I think that it was clearly communicated decision on whether or not this is truly right. What or who just can't have right to go back on urban life is it's like, you know, up front in, I was going to ask, would you ever go back and do you think so again?"
Cathy Naugle,01:09:28:02,01:10:01:14,"I think it's a great, because it takes a year. It's like, when normal. I think people who quit smoking on their own food or any other health, takes a walk with the body to get all this out. I think, with a lot of water hours. Yeah. it takes at least a year to get through urban life and use this time to readjust your thinking, to gear down to a slower pace."
Cathy Naugle,01:10:01:14,01:10:22:00,"I mean, be quick to get a slower pace. Yeah, there's more to do. It really does take longer to do. maybe get a little more thorough. Thank you. Tara, try to relax. was that hard for you at first? like it was so hard because I was so used to being done 11 hours a day."
Cathy Naugle,01:10:22:02,01:10:48:15,"coming home, going from work and shopping or my days off and just not romantic. Me. So, yeah, it was it took a great deal. And I. Idaho to be able to take a look around. You feel like you're about to. Yeah. How did how do you do you keep in touch with a lot of your friends from California?"
Cathy Naugle,01:10:48:17,01:11:22:05,"mostly transfer because we corresponded practically on my father's. Where am I? Right here. What did people say? How did they do this? So now they're different, that we're here. so a couple guys with a lot of reactions. I bet you have. We have a big. We change. Our whole thought process changes. I don't think I did not see her have a good eye for battle."
Cathy Naugle,01:11:22:08,01:11:28:02,"yes, I did. I have no idea. I thought, like, the majority."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:11:28:04,01:11:32:27,When I got married and tried to.
Cathy Naugle,01:11:32:27,01:11:34:18,Reach our family.
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:11:34:20,01:11:39:09,It's difficult to get our.
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:11:39:11,01:11:40:15,Family back.
Cathy Naugle,01:11:40:17,01:12:09:16,"And, I keep in touch with my very best friend, Jan. Is that. Does that put a lot of strains on our relationship? I've asked Tom the same thing. Yeah, yeah. because we have to separate from from here. Being a girl is just impossible. We can't serve two masters. my dad's girlfriend, Chris, became a friend, and I wrote to her, and she quit, right?"
Cathy Naugle,01:12:09:19,01:12:37:29,"For three months, I could never come back, right? just battled over, my life, which is chapter of wonderful. She can write with this agreement. And I never talked to plan. I would rather learn from her. Go out on me. I'm just a better. I'm just the means that I can live to be all along, you know, if that's all right."
Cathy Naugle,01:12:38:02,01:12:58:20,it's. And you I get with a real sense of stand up work. That's it. I'm becoming what? Christ. In return for second place. And I'm used to. routing. get out of my memory banks now. It's taken me a while.
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:12:58:22,01:13:10:07,"But I grow strong, and I more and more. Maybe I'll become the next I field."
Cathy Naugle,01:13:10:10,01:13:40:18,"Well, it's that, you know, I think it's, another, another way of finding your identity here. I keep asking you about, you know, are you finding yourself and and that's where you're finding yourself. I found I tried all the other ways. Yeah, yeah, I was trying and living on my I tried to. That was world. I was that time."
Cathy Naugle,01:13:40:20,01:13:51:23,"Yeah. Well, I tried go. Being fulfilled as a what if I couldn't find it marriage."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:13:51:23,01:13:56:22,I found out or that if you're.
Cathy Naugle,01:13:56:24,01:14:23:15,"I oh. I mean, you don't have to try. I, I think you only identify with just, Well, good. Yeah, yeah. So good that you didn't have to go through that check me out on my farm. So I tried to get some farmer. I'm just not. No, I think that's a really the. The last thing I was going to ask is, do you have anything you just like to say as the person you are now?"
Cathy Naugle,01:14:23:15,01:14:52:11,"And how do you feel about yourself? And it sounds like you feel good that I'm beginning to like, let's begin. I spent years putting myself down. Although I. And that would be good, Back up. So cool. Down, down. Yeah. Okay. I find that I get, I lose myself."
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:14:52:14,01:14:54:19,I pick up for myself.
Cathy Naugle,01:14:54:21,01:15:00:29,To find yourself. Right? losing. Right. when I get my mind.
Brenda Fay Lewis,01:15:00:29,01:15:06:15,"Off of me, you get it on other people and everything."
Cathy Naugle,01:15:06:18,01:15:19:13,All of this. It all. I just can't think of a better place to start. Unless you've got something else you'd like to.
